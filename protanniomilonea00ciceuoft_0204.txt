130 A PPENDIX II.

day ¹. He appears to have looked upon his office as a virtual dictator-
ship. A dictator retained his power for six months only, and Pompey
voluntarily imposed upon himself a similar restriction of time. Upon
the first of August he, as Mommsen says, ‘ resigned his dictatorship, and
shared the consulship with his client, Metellus Scipio ²! It is obvious
that by this time his task must have been completed, since otherwise
he would not have surrendered the extraordinary powers granted to him.
Two trials, however, those of the tribunes, Plancus Bursa and Pompeius
Rufus, are supposed to have taken place sometime after the others, at the
end of the year, or early in 51 nc. This is inferred from the well-known
fact that the tribunes entered upon and vacated office on Dec. 10. It is
therefore argued that their trial must have been subsequent to this date.
The most important document bearing upon the subject is a letter of
Cicero, written shortly after the condemnation of Bursa³. In this he
says, ‘ nos hic in mullitudine et celebritate iudiciorum et nomis- legibus ita
distinemur, ut cotidie vota faciamus, ne intercaletur, ut quam primum
te videre possimus,’ i. e. he is very busy with cases, and fears that the
vacatiori, during which he would visit his correspondent, may be put
off by a possible intercalation. Schmidt, in his careful discussion of the
’ date to be assigned to this letter, is inclined to place the trial of Plancus
at the end of January, or the beginning of February in 51 ⁴. I would remark
that the phrase multitudo et celebritas iudiciorum would be appropriate
if it were written at the time when Cicero and Hortensius were pleading
every day in fresh cases ⁵, but is somewhat out of place, if these two trials
came by themselves and formed a sequel to the general body of cases.
The mention of novae leges also suggests the period of Pompey' s ex-
ceptional power, rather than 51 13.e., when he was no longer in office, and
things had gone back to their normal condition. The intercalation
referred to is supposed by Schmidt to be the ordinary one of a month
in February, such as had taken place in 52 13.c. As a matter of fact„
however, there was no intercalation in 51, so that, if this was what
Cicero feared, his apprehensions were not realised. In the accounts
given by later writers, it is never hinted in any way that the cases of
the two tribunes were separated by any considerable interval from the
others. Dio Cassius⁶ says ὅ τε οὖν Μίλων οὕτως ἑάλω καὶ ὁ Ῥοῦφος ὅ τε
Πλάγκος, ἐπειδὴ πρῶτον ἐκ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἐξῆλθον, ἄλλοι τε σὺν ,αὐτοῖς συχνοί,
