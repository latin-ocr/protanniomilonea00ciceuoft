x PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

nothing new is to be obtained. He seems to regard the‘ murder of
Clodius as an incident in the sole-consulship of Pompey, instead of the
immediate cause which brought it about. This was natural, since the
results were so important as to dwarf the accident which‘made them
possible. The one original statement which he makes, that Cato
voted for the acquittal of Milo, is a bold one, since the more cautious ⁷
Asconius reports that he could not obtain any certain information upon
the subject.

(iv) 'I'he Scholiasta Bobiensis (saecl. ivlv); a name given to ἐ
what appears to be a corpus of scholia of different date and value. Ξ
The composite character of these is readily seen. Thus the sacrilege ’ἡ
of Clodius is described both in the Argument to the de Aere alieno j
Milonis, and also in a note to the same speech, the two accounts·
being clearly due to separate writers. So on ἕ 14 of this speech, divisa ἲ
sententia est is erroneously explained, whereas the reference in the Argu— Ι
ment agrees with the account given by Asconius. The relation of these
scholia to Asconius has been frequently discussed. Gaumitzl holds that
they are wholly independent [‘ er hochst wahrscheinlieh dessen (sc. Ascon.) ’
Kommentar zur Miloniana gar nicht kannte’]. This opinion he bases
upon certain divergencies‚ notably the different explanations given of the
previous conduct attributed to Domitius [ξ 22]. Ι show in my note that Α
the discrepancy is in reality a very slight one, since they both refer to ’
action taken by him against the same Manilius. To me it appears> ’.
that the Scholiast is sometimes paraphrasing Asconius, while on other ᾗ
occasions he misunderstands him. Thus when Asconius says of Pompey i
that he was sitting ad aerarium, i.e. in front of the temple of Saturn, the 15
Scholiast expands this, and says primo quidem iudices consederunt in aede
Saturni. His statement that Clodius fied melu peragz'latus . . . in cau-
ponulam is an imaginative one, while his reference to Pompey as being
then consul without a colleague is at least misleading. On the whole, ί
except as containing scraps from earlier authorities, and probably from
Asconius, Ι should not be inclined to attach much importance to these
scholia, at least so far as this speech is concerned. ’

We have also detailed accounts in three Greek writers, whom 1 take in ’
order of importance.

(v) Plutarch refers to the trial and events connected with it in his ,
lives of Cicero, chs. 33-35, Cato minor, 47—48, Pompey, 54-55, and '³
Caesar, 28. He gives us a good deal of independent information, and ’ᾗ
consulted original documents. In his life of Cicero he refers e. g. to =
