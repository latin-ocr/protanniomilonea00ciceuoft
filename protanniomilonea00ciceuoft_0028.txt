xviii PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

    
      

coming from Lanuvium, a township which had also sent to Rome at
this period the actor Roscius and the consul Murena ¹. The family of
Papii seems to have been of Samnite origin, and the name frequently
occurs in the annals of the secular struggle waged by that hardy race
with Rome. On his mother’s side he was connected with a good Roman
family, that of the Annii Lusci, which had produced two consuls in the
previous century. He was adopted by his grandfather, Τ. Annius, who ·
left him his fortune. His own name was properly T. Annius, but he was ·
generally known by the nickname Milo, probably given to him since his
physical powers recalled those of the famous athlete of Croton ².

The fierce blood in Milo made fighting a joy as well as a profession to
him, and he eagerly embraced the new career made possible for him by
the anarchy at Rome. If Clodius enlisted slaves, Milo assembled ’
gladiators‚ and by the help of their swords drove him from the streets.
It was to Milo, and to him alone, as Cicero gratefully records, that he ,
owed his restoration from exile. Pompey condescended to use him 'as ⁷
a tool, and he became the great optimate hero. No one ventured toi*¹
reproach him with his municipal extraction. The most fashionable
circles were open to him, and when Fausta, daughter of Sulla, a great .
lady with a seamy past, wedded the doughty fighter on November 17, 55,
he became connected with the proudest families in Rome ⁸. Her caprice, '
it is true, did not last long, since she was soon afterwards surprised with Ἴ
a lover, the historian and moralist‚ Sallust ⁴. ,

The political career of Milo began in 57 B. c. and was terminated by ³
his exile in 52. During this time he was in constant opposition to 3:
Clodius. The story of their struggles is so familiar to every reader of y
Roman history that it need not be repeated here. It is, however, in the
light of after events, interesting to read these words of Cicero about his ζ
‘hero' late in 57 13.c. ‘His courage is astonishing. I say nothing of
recent superhuman acts of his. The sum of the whole matter is this. Α

by Milo, if indeed he does not kill him first. 1f he comes near Milo in

a daughter of Pompey. Fausta’s half-brother Scaurus was connected with the*
Claudian house by marriage, his wife Mucia being a sister-in-law of Clodia (Fam. v.' ·
2. 6). It is noteworthy‚ that it was her niece, Pompeia, who had been compromised ,
by Clodius in the affair of the Bona Dea, while her nephew, Q. Pompeius Rufus,
openly took Clodius as his model (Ascon. on ξ 67). ¹
