where the use of this topic, sc. tempus, is
discussed. Reid says that noctu== ‘ by
night ' in Cic.‚ while nocte is used with an

however, it supposes a proprius error
common to both samilies os MSS„ while
quid is perfectly good Latin, I hesitate to

receive it. The word causa found in H
is probably due to an accidental repetition
of causa from the previous line.

1. properato : this is the only example
of this construction in the speeches. Krebs-
Allg. remark that ‘it is common in old
poets: in good prose it is confined to
certain recognized formulae, e. g. opus est
dictu is not found in Cicero.’ Aul. Gell.
xvi. 14 quotes from a speech of Cato, ‘ qui
unum quid mature transigit, is properat,
qui multa simul incipit neque perficit, is
fislinat.' The quotation seems to have
been a current one, as it is also given by
the Schol. Bob. on this passage. The
words are used as synonyms Phil. ix. 6.

si quia esset : Clodius may have been
in a hurry to make his cretio hereditatis,
to protect his interests from his hostile
coheres.

2. postridie mane: so five times in
the speeches. Mane postridie occurs Phil.
ix. 9. Other phrases are postero die mane,
and postridie eius diei mane.

3. atqui: I read with Asconius: the con-
fusion with atque is constant. Reid on
Ac. ii 21 says that ‘atqui is never a mere
particle of transition, but always intro-
duces a distinct stage in the development
of an argument.' For its idiomatical use
in introducing the minor premiss of a
syllogism see Nat. D. ii. 16 and Madv. on
Fin. i. 59.

5. noctu: an archaic form for nocte,
which occurs twelve times in the speeches.
Cf. ad Herenn. ii. 7 noctu an interdiu,

epithet after a preposition, or in the phrase
die et nocte.

6. noctu . . . oenias-sot: this pas-
sage is omitted in TE, in the archetype of
which a line must have dropped out, as
was seen by Richter, Jahrb. 1862, p. 632
[‘ es scheint eine Zeile in der gemeinsamen
Quelle von TE u. a. iibersprungen zu sein.’]
lt. appears first as a marginal addition,
and then is incorporated in the text of
fifteenth-century Italian MSS. For the
source of these additions in the late dett.
see p. xxxv. Halm, Jahrb. 1855, p. 110,
objects (i) ‘that it is only found in late
MSS.‚' an objection which cannot now be
urged, as it is in H, tii) ‘that occidisset
without an object is unusua1.’ For this
Ι would refer to ξ 57 occideritne? occidit,
sc. eum, (iii) ‘ that -oso et pleno latr. in
loco is not a Ciceronian rhythm.’ This
1 deny. Cicero is very fond of such
homoioteleuta, (iv) ‘that it adds nothing
to the sense! This is not the case: noctu
and latronum in loco present the points
afterwards taken up by latronum . . .
locus, and caeca nox, the ehiastic arrange-
ment being intentional.

9. salvum: ς 5 n.

10. occultator: no other instance of
this word is quoted: for such coinages by
Cic. cf. ξ 35 n.

receptor: ἅπαξ λεγ. in Cicero, who,
however, has receptrix Verr. iv. 17, v. 160.
ln the jurists it =‘ receiver of stolen
goods.' Reperlor, the reading originally
given in H, may be right: for the word
