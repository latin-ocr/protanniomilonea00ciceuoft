date exactly agrees with the statement of
the accusem, quoted by Quintil. vi. 3. 49

thus Halm says os recurrere ‘die auf den
Wege nach Rom sehon etwas vorans
waren.’ This does violence to the language
os Cicero here and in 5 53, and would

 

‘quod Bovillas ante horam nonam dever-

, is verified by the fact that the eorpse
“ reached Rome ante primam noctis horam,

story see> Schol. Bob. ad loc. That it is

meant to deceive is obvious from the
vngueneoe of the details. Cicero’s con-

¹ ception- appears to be that Clodius is

mtioned on a height, edito atque excelso
low, ς 53, either at the top of the hill, or
more probably beside the road. When

were following it. Milo's retinue is thus
united in three places, The editors

main identical with tha given by Ascon.,

3. reiecta: i.e. thrown back over his
shoulder: cs. de Or. ii. 294 ut non modo
non abiecto, sed ne reiecto quidem scuto

xl. 30.

4. recurrere : i. e. ‘run behind ’ rather
than ‘run back to ἐ decurrere, the con·
jecture of Rau, would yield an excellent
sense.

8. pax-timemini: according to Metellus
Scipio, the only casualties on Milo's side
were two wounded [Ascon. 36] !

10. servi. milonis: the repetition of
servi is intentional, as laying stress upon
the statement that the slaves acted upon
their own initiative : cf. 5 57 ne tormentis
cogerentur [sc. servi Milonis] occisum
esse a servis Milonis in Appia via P.
Clodium confiteri. It is singular that
Bake should have suspected these words,
which also occur in the citation of Quintil.
vii. 1. 36.

11. aperte: the word imparts an air
of candour to the story, at the point

where the advocate ventures upon his ,

boldest fiction. Cicero speaks as if
Csoffiiis was killed on the spot, and
wholly suppresses the fact that he was
murdered in cold blood outside the tavern
at Bovillae by Milo’s orders: Ascon. 33.
