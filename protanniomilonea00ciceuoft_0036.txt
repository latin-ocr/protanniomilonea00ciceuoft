guished men in Rome. Among them was the moralist, Cato, who on
entering the box ceased to be a partisan 3 a formidable juror, whom thr}v
culprit hesitated to challenge lest it should be thought he had a bad con-3
science ¹, and who incorruptibly condemned friend and foe alike. .
Public opinion was becoming increasingly hostile to Milo. The mist
of passion began to list, and men saw with horror the precipice yawning
before them. A fit of morality passed over Rome, and to appease the
conscience of the community‚ a victim had to be found. Milo was a mart
of no illusions, and saw that he was lost. He refused to go into mourning,
and appeared with that old defiant 100k2, which men knew so well. That
he had no aversion to the ordinary methods of exciting compassion is]
clearly shown by his behaviour two years before, when he had been one]
of the kneeling suppliants who entreated mercy for Scaurus⁸. Two'
friends at least were staunch to him, Caelius and Cicero. That Caelius
should have been faithful is no matter for surprise. His attachmen
were warm, and the opportunity of flouting, not only public opinion, bu

creditable to him, since the tribunes, Q. Pompeius Rufus, and Plancu 5

Milo meanwhile had been accused on four counts, two of course bein' ,
under Pompey’s laws. For the murder he was prosecuted by tw
nephews of the dead man, whose right to bring the charge noun-1
disputed. They also laid a charge of bribery against him, but here the l
had first to compete with rival accusers. The right to prosecute w ,ῑ
finally awarded to them. He was also accused of having entered in ’,ζ
illegal associations (de sodalz‘cz'zzv), and of riot, apparently under
provisions of the old lex Cornelia ⁴. The prosecutors under the two latt
charges were mercenary persons who hoped for a judgment by default, '
which case they would claim the reward given to a successful accuser. .
The Presidents in the two courts‚ which were to hear the first or t· ÷
serious charg'es, both fixed on April 4 for the opening of the case. T
collision was merely a formal one, since when the day came, Torquatu·
the President de ambitu, postponed the case until the trial for murder ’ν ἶ ’
over. The trial took four days, three of which were occupied by tf
examination of witnesses. On the first day there was an incipient rio
