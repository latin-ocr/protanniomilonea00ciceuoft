THE SOURCES OF THE TEXT. xlvii

      

fwibe was copying more ancient originals than formerly ¹. These folios
contain the speeches before Caesar, pro Milone, de Imp. Cn. Pompei, ex-
  cerpts from the Verrines, and de Officiis i, ii part. In the first of these the
MS. is a gemellus of A [Ambros. x cent.], in the Verrine selections it is
ᾗ closely connected with R [Reg. Par. x cent.], in the de Officiis, with
³ B [Bamberg. x cent.], in all cases the best authorities ². That the pro
ζ Milone and de Imp. Cn. Pompei are drawn from an equally good source
<1 cannot doubt. This part of the MS. then differs considerably from
&hat containing the Cato maior, Laelius, and speeches against Catiline,
ζ to which I attribute little authority. I mention this, since in some of
’- the kindly notices received by my Anecdoton the distinction did not seem
ζ to be realized ³.
As to the provenance of the MS„ that acute scholar L. Mendelssohn‚
² speaking of the Epp. ad Familiares, the latter half of which it contains,
³ has made the interesting guess that they may have been taken from
the MSS. which we know from the ancient catalogue to have existed at
Lorsch ⁴. In view of this conjecture it must not be forgotten that the
' same library contained one of the three copies of the pro M‘lone mentioned
in the catalogues ³. It is, therefore, not improbable that this portion of
the MS. was drawn from the same source.
’ Lastly‚ asto the character of its recension, what degree of authority can
be ascribed to this, our most reliable MS.? Is it free from glosses, or
interpolations? The answer is ‘ certainly not.’ No MS. is, certainly no
. gith cent. MS. Thus ξ 7 for dzzvputant it gives dzlrputant. obiciunt, and § 81
’ 'adds potiussr after ingratius, which I cannot but consider an interpolation.
· The merit, however, which I would claim sor it, is thatin it a corruption is
frequently found in its rudimentary form, while in TE it has been disguised.
Thus in ξ 102 it gives the unconstrueable gra [i. e. gratia] ingentibus,
while TE disguise the lacuna by the plausible grata gentibus. So ξ 46 ex
, , quibus id facillime scire posset, H adds homines seila-el, a very crude
addition, while TE amplify into omnes scilicet Lanuvini. In ξ 79 quin sic
ἰ attendite iudices, H adds nempe. de interitu P. Clodi, the note of a sciolus
from the margin : TE develop this into nempe haec est quaestio de interitu
P. Clodi. So ξ 43 Η gives quise ille [τῷδε Stangl] . . . putaret, which
does not construe: TE hide the corruption by quin se ille, which gives
ψ a construction but perverts the sense. T is an especial offender in this
way, continually attempting to hide corruptions, or to incorporate additions
’ ’ in the text.
