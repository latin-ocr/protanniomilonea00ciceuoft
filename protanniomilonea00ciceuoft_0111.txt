1. tm: ‘ on all these occasions' 2 tum

’ ,, corresponds to the repeated cum in the

previous sections. The variant tamen
gives an equally good sense, and the con-
usion in MSS. [sc. between ta and m] is
constant.

2. ιι indictum bia: the first ocea-
sion was early in 57 Β. c., before the recall
of Cicero. It was because he was frus-
trated in his attempt to get legal redress,
that, according to Cicero, Milo then used
vis. This first accusation is referred to,
Sen. ¹9 primo de vi postulavit, Sest. 89
descondit ad accusandum. He was foiled
by Metellus Nepos, who would not allow
ι jury to be empanelled, or the courts to
sit, Sest. l. c.‚ Dio C. xxxix. 7. The second
occasion is referred to in a letter of Cicero,
written in Nov. 57, reum Publium . . .
stre a Milone puto, where also he refers
to the previous charge, antea, cum iudi-
cium nolebat, Att. iv. 3. 2. On this· occasion
the ffiends of Clodius contended that the
election of aediles, sor which post he was
standing, should take place before any
iudicia. That Metellus Nepos took the
lead then also would appear from a letter
of his written in 56, where he says ‘bis
eum invitum servavi,' Fam. v. 3. 2. T hese
two occasions have been confused by
many commentators. It is worthy of
notice that in the Har. Resp.—delivered
in Ma 56 [Rauschen‚ Ephem. Tull. pp.
13, μιῖ-ει third prosecution of Clodius

Milo, then a priwtus, threatened to
accuse Clodius, then curule aedile. For

this there were ancient precedents, though
the practice had become obsolete. Varro
ap. Aul. Gell. xiii. 13 says, ‘ M. Laevinus,
aedilis curulis a privato ad praetorem in
ius est vocatus! Cs. Ascon. on 5 88 n.
The conjecture of Jeep in this passage,
de vi for bis, is ingenious, but perverse.
Cicero constantly opposes vis and iudi-
cium ξ 70 n. They form one antithesis,
and bis . . . numquam another.

3. privato unone: sc. in 56 13.c.
after his tribunate.

4. cn. Pompeium: on. Feb. 6, 56.
Pompey got through his speech in spite
of constant interruption. The riot was
commenced by the ‘ gangs’ of Clodius,
but eventually the optimates charged,
and stormed the rostra. Cf. Q. F. ii. 3. 2,
infr. 5 68, and ξ 36 n.

o. Π. Antonius: in 53 13.c., when
standing sor the quaestorship. He had
previously been a friend of Clodius during
the latter's tribunate, and was now cne of
the accusers [Ascon. 42]‚ being probably
already under the influence of Fulvia.
Cicero relates this story, in order to show
the inconsistency of Autony. So in § 75
he dwells upon the outrageous conduct of
Clodius to his brother Appius, now the
father by adoption of the Appii fratres,
who were prosecuting. Cf. ξ 75 n.

11. tn scalarum tenebras: Ascon. in
Cornel. tells a similar story. The Cominii
brothers accused Cornelius, and were
attacked by noti operarum duces. The
Cominii ‘curn in scalas quasdam fugissent.
clausi in noctem ibi se occultaverunt,
deinde per tecta vicinorum profugerunt ex
urbe.' The accusative tenebras is the
regular idiom with abdere in Cicero, e. g.
Pis. 93 domum se abdidit, except with the
