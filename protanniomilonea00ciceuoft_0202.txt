128 APPENDIX I.

would not be likely to allow a ‘blank day’ during which intrigues might
be practised.

Halm accordingly supposes that, although the trial was originally
meant to extend over five days, ‘for some unexplained reason‚' the
proceedings were curtailed‚ the aequatio pilorum being taken on the
third day. He does not however notice that, if so, either the trial did
not begin on the fourth, or else it ended before the eighth of April.

It is now generally recognized that the supposed discrepancy in
Asconius rests upon a mistranslation. When he says quarta die . . .
adesse iuberentur he means ‘they were ordered to be present on the
fourth day‚’ not ‘on the fourth day they were ordered to be present‚'
i.e. next day. (It is usual, and probably right, to cut out z‘n diem posterum
as an addition. The passage can, however, be construed in this sense
with them, since in legal language such pleonasms are not uncommon.)
For the construction of the passage I refer to my note.

According to this explanation, which is that of Wirz and Richter-
Eberhard, the diary of the trial would be :—-

Days 1-3. Hearing of evidence, followed by the aequatio pilorum.
Day 4. Sortz'tz'o, and speeches.

The contio of Plancus would come on the third day post audita et
obszgn. test. verba, and on the eve of the summus dies according to the
testimony of Cicero and Asconius.

A difficulty, however, still remains, since the five days, April 4 to 8, .

have in some way to be accounted for. It is therefore supposed that,
although przd.‘N0n. April. Milo affuit, the trial did not actually begin
on that day, but on the fifth, the fourth being given up to preliminaries,
e. g.- the hearing of the evidence obtained from slaves. According to
this vieW, when Asconius says primo die, he means on the second day, or,
as Richter-Eberhard say on quarta die, ‘ Am vierten Tage—also dem
fiinften des ganzen Prozesses—-fand die Schlussverhandlung statt!

The solution which Ι propose is a different one. ‘The date upon
which the trial began, sc. prid. Non. April„ cannot have been corrupted.
That on which the· verdict was given is, however, in a very different
position, A.n. vi is only given by the MSS. in Ascon. 31, in 41 they have
A. D. iii or ii. I read A.n. vii in both places, i. e. April 7. The con-
fusion of numerals is so constant in MSS. as not to require illustration.
The omission or insertion of ί before Idus is especially easy. Thus
Fam i. 5¹⁰. 1. we find a.d. vz'iz' Idus, whereas Q. F. ii. 3 the same events
are ascribed to a. d. viz· Idus ¹. In Asconius the dates given by the
