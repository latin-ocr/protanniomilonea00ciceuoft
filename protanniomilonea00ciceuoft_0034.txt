of office. A series of interreges followed, all equally impotent to hold . .‡
election. Meanwhile Rome was given up to the horrors of mob- law
A funeral feast 1n honour of Clodius was celebrated eight days after by
the crowd in the Forum¹. The passions of the mob were excited t
fever— heat by the daily meetings of the three tribunes. On the othe*
hand, the indomitable Caelius harangued his partisans.

At last it became necessary to do something, and so, either in the inter
calary month ², or late in February, which preceded it, the senate issue· Α
a formal commission to ‘the interrex, the tribunes, and Pompeius, the
proconsul stationed outside of Rome‚' to take measures for the public
securityss. On receiving this charge, Pompey acted with his ancient
rapidity. At the stamp of his foot recruits came pouring in from the
country towns of Italy, and he became master of the situation. The
disorder ceased. Milo offered to give up his candidature, if Pompey
wished. Pompey replied with one of those haughty answers which he
knew so well how to give to his old friends⁴. Meanwhile the interregnum
still continued, though obviously it must soon end. The only function
of an interrex was to elect a consul: and there was no longer any diffi-5
culty about holding the comitia. As, however, the military power was in.
the hands of Pompey, it was out of the question to create magistrate
superior to himself. The natural solution therefore was to make him
dictator. The senate compromised matters, by inventing for him th·
title of sole-consul, which was given him on the proposition os Bibulus,
seconded by Cato, who thus confessed the failure of their endeavour to
govern without him. The carefully-planned combination of Pompe
was thus entirely successful. The assembly was convened by the*¹
interrex, Servius Sulpicius, and he was duly elected on the 24th day of*
the intercalary month.

On the 27th Pompey assembled the senate. It was impossible for the
friends of Milo to resist the demand for a judicial inquiry; but they
managed to include within its scope the riots which had followed in.
Rome, as well as the murder itself‚ thus placing a number of Pompey's
adherents in an awkward position. They also proposed that Milo should
be tried extra ordinem before a special commission. Nothing was sain„
about the composition of this body, which therefore would have been?

² The sen. cons. ultimum is antedated by Dio, xl. 49, who assigns it to the evening
of Jan. 19. This is inconsistent with the statement of Ascon. 35, who ascribes it ω’
the failure of the interreges to hold the elections‚ and incompatible with the ina&
tivity of Pompey, who on the 22nd (Asc. on ξ 67) was still in his horti doing
nothing.
