insolvent condition made it likely that he would endeavour to enrich
himself at the public expense. This must have been a mere form, and
Milo treated it as such, returning his debts at 6,000,000 sesterces ¹.
Clodius thereupon publicly questioned Milo upon the subject in the
senate, and was replied to by Cicero, who inveighed against the past‘
career of Clodius in terms similar to those used in the pro lllt'lone, and
particularly denounced the proposal of Clodius to give equal voting'
rights to the freedmen.
The year closed without any elections having taken place. There
were no magistrates at Rome, except the tribunes, and these, with the
connivance of Pompey‚ who saw the fruit now within his grasp, would
not allow an interrex to be chosen, with a view to the ultimate holding.
of the comitia. At last came the inevitable end. The rivals met upon
the Appian Way, and the fate which had so long been hanging over
Clodius descended upon him. The story of the murder is told by
Asconius with scrupulous fairness. He probed the facts to the bottom,
and has given us an account which is a model of patient research. Ψ*
That the encounter was an accidental one is the conclusion of
Asconius, and there is no reason to doubt the truth of this. If the
murder had taken place during the fray, it is possible that a lenient view
would have been taken of the occurrence, as in more modern times, 2·
when a duellist killed his antagonist in fair fight. The Romans however, δ’
with their sentimental regard for the life of a Roman, even if he were i
a criminal, heard with horror how the defenceless and bleeding wretchj
had been dragged out of his hiding-place, robbed of his ring, and ‘t
butchered on the high-read, while the keeper of the tavern at Bovillae, ³
who had given him shelter, shared his fate. There were ugly tales in a
circulation as to what happened after the murder. A credible witness, ³
a person of some position ², in whose villa near Ulubrae, not far from ἶ
