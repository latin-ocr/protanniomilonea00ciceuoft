IN MILONIANAM.

seutentiam S. C. Pompeius ab interrege Servio Sulpicio V Kal.
Mart. mense intercalario consul creatus est statimque consu-

latum iniit.

Deinde post diem tertium de legibus novis ferendis

rettulit: duas ex S. C. promulgavit, alteram de vi, qua nominatim
§medem in Appia via factam et incendium curiae et domum
M. Lepidi interregis oppugnatam comprehendit, alteram de

ambitu: poena graviore et forma iudiciorum breviore.

Utraque

enim lex prius testes dari, deinde uno die atque eodem et ab
accusatore et a reo perorari iubebat, ita ut duae horae accusatori,

ἰο tres reo darentur.

His legibus obsistere M. Caelius tr. pl. studio-

sissimus Milonis conatus est, quod et privilegium diceret in

Milonem ferri et iudicia praecipitari.

Et cum pertinacius leges

Caelius vituperaret, eo processit irae Pompeius, ut diceret, si
ἶ ὀοειοῒιιε esset, se armis rem publicam defensurum. Timebat
¹5 autem Pompeius Milonem seu timere se simulabat: plerumque
non domi suae, sed in hortis manebat, idque ipsum in superioribus,

citca quos etiam magna manus militum excubabat.

Senatum

quoque semel repente dimiserat Pompeius, quod diceret timere
Δ se adventum Milonis. Dein proximo senatu P.. Cornificius ferrum

likel that the new regulations were
potensi-r to the two special quaestiones,
md away with them: cf. Willems,
Droit public, p. 318. The language of
Cicero, Att. xiii. 19. 1 scis enim dies
illorum iudiciorum praestitutos fuisse,
implies that the system was·not still in
some. It is diff-cult to suppose that such
trinis as those described by Caelius [Fam.

viii. 8] were conducted under the re-
strictions introduced by Pompey.

11. privssegdum: against the pro·
visions of the XII Tables: cf. Leg. iii. 44
in privatos homines ferri noluerunt: id
est enim privilegium. A special inquiry
into the case of Milo could, however,
hardly be described as a breach os this
statute. A precedent at any rate was
furnished by the rogatio brought sorward
in 61 B.c. providing sor the trial of
Clodius de incestu by specially selected

16. domi suae: the house of Pompey
at this time was close to the theatre
bearing his name, being a sort of ‘ annexe '
to it [ὥσπερ ἐφόλκιόν τι] Plut. Pomp. 40.
It was situated in the neighbourhood of
the
Campo di Fiori. Pompey built this
house, which was a modest one, in 61 Β. C.‚
after his return from the Mithridatio war.
Previously he had lived in one still more
unpretending.
