48 M. TULLI CICERONIS

Quid ergo erat? mora et tergiversati03 dum hic veniret, locum
relinquere noluit.

quam nisi in raeda, tum in equ03 comites Graeculi, quocumque 5
ibat, etiam cum in castra Etrusca properabat3 tum nugarum in
comitatu nihil. Milo, qui numquam, tum casu pueros sympho—
niacos uxoris ducebat et ancillarum greges3 ille, qui semper
secum scorta, semper exoletos, semper lupas duceret, tum nemi-
nem, nisi ut virum a viro lectum esse diceres. Cur igitur victus
est? quia non semper viator a latrone, non numquam etiam
latro a viatore occiditur; quia, quamquam paratus in imparatos

1. erat om. E. mora et tergiversatio H: morae et tergiversationis rell.; morae
et tergiversationes Bait. 5. nisi: ut δ. 6. in comit. nug. E. 9. duceret ὃ.
13. ipse Clodius H : om. rell.; voc. {ose ante Clod. del. Richt.

8. uxoris: Fausta would naturally
require such companions to solace her
ennuz' when going into the country. The
aceusers doubtless used about them the
same scurrilous language as that which

1. quid ergo erat: ‘ quid ergo (or
igitur) are used in argument: quid ergo
or (igilur) est in narration' [Landgr. on
Rosc. Am. 36].

mora. et tergiversatio: the variant -ae

10

et —is is due to quid, which was thought to
require a genitive. The plural -ae et -es‚
generally read, is explained as = ‘ repeated
delays, or shuffling.' For the singular
tergiversatio cs. Att. x. 7. 1, B. Afr. viii. 4:
the plural is only quoted from Frontinus,
Aquaed. 4. The description of Clodius’
loitering here given is of course incon·
sistent with the story of the prosecutors,
sc. that he was hurrying on account of the
news that Cyrus was dead, ξ 49.

4. antea: ‘this form of the adverb is
more recent than ante. It does not occur
in Plautus, and is only once found in Ter.
Cicero uses ante chiefly in the earlier
speeches, and in the Philippics, in which
several characteristics of his youthful
sty]le reappear' [Landgr. on Rosc. Am.
2¹3

6. castra. Etrusca. it is more natural
to refer these words to the ‘forays' of
Clodius in Etruria, cf. §§ 26, 50, 74, 98,
than with Ascon. to see in them an allu-
sion to the story that Clodius started to
join the Catilinarians at Faesulae. Cf.
Schol. Bob. de Aere al. ii. 2.

nug-arum: ef. Q. F. i. 2. 4 ego nugas
maximas omni mea comitate complexus
sum.

Cicero employs concerning the usual
retinue of Clodius. Such a description
seems to have been a commonplace iu
Roman rhetoric, · cf. the ‘realistic’ descrip-

tion of C. Antonius’ suite by Caelius, ἢ

Quintil. iv. 2. 12 3, and the famous passage
eonceming Antony, Phil. ii. 58. Cicero
also describes Verres on the march, Verr.
v. 26 sqq. In the case of Antony there
does seem to have been some foundation
for the charges brought τ cf. Att. x. 10. 5.

10 virum a viro: a familiar method
of forming a picked band, e. g. Liv. x. 38.
12, xxi. 54. 3, Tac. Hist. i. 18. Aug-ustus
employed it to reconstitute the senate:
Suet. Aug. 35. Vergil uses the phrase m
a novel sense, Aen. xi. 632 legitque virum
vir, of one foe picking out another.

13 clodius,1pse clodius. the omis-
sion of ipse Clodi'us 1n TE is due to the
eye of the writer having stra yed from the
first to the second Clodius, afertile source
of corruption. The single Clodius was
suspicions, since, as Richter remarks, ‘why
should the name, which was not mentioned
in the question, be introduced between the
antithetical clauses and the answer'ss' His
excision, however, made the sentence
somewhat bald.
