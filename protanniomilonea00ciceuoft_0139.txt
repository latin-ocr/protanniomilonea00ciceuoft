1. hou Prilio τ sc.Lago di Castiglione:
sor its situation cf. Dennis, Cities and
Cemeteries of Etruria, ii. ²53· The
spelling is uncertain. Plin. N. H. iii.
51 speaks of amnes Prille, while in the
Itiner. Antonini it is three times men-
tioned aa lacus Aprilis.

insnum: the repetition is necessary
in order to prevent ambiguity.

². materiem: for the form cf. ξ 35 n.‚
for the meaning, ‘timber,’ cf. Verr. i.
147 non materies ulla advecta est, and
Vitruvius, ii. ch. ix. The alnus was the
best wood for piles, and lasted for ever in

marshy ground 3 e.g. the whole of Ravenna¹

was built in this way. Clodius, when
building on an island, would probably
begin by sinking piles. Timber would
also be required to form the ‘long wooden
box, into which the concrete was poured '
[Middleton‚ i. p. 47].

emensae-⁴ stone,’ cf. Div. ii. 99 in
latere aut in caemento, ex quibus urbs
effecta est. Cicero, who, sor an amateur,
had a thorough knowledge of building‚
is here enumerating the materials used
in concrete, structura caementicia; cf.
Middleton, i. p. 44 sq„ and Vitruvius,
ii. ch. vii. The best kinds of stone were
lapis Albanus, the modern peperim, and
lap. Tibertinus, sc. travertine. In making
concrete, broken lumps of these were
mixed with lime.

mom:=‘1ime,’ generally made by
hurning travertine; cf. Viti-nv. ii. ch. v,
where rules forits use are given.

et una calcis coiciantur’ [Vitruv. ii. ch. ν,
Pliny, N .H. xxxvi. 175]. By a metaphor
drawn from this process, Caligula de-
scribed the style of Seneca as harenam
sine calce [Suet. Cal. 53]. The variant,
arma (i) spoils the sense, since then the
most important of Clodius' materials is
omitted, and (ii) is difficult to explain.
If taken literally it does not suit the
madcap audacity of Clodius [Spengel,
Philol. xxii. 98]‚ while the sense of ‘ tools ’
assigned to it from, e.g. Aen. i. 177 Cerea-
liaque arma, or Mart. xiv. 36 is a mere
figment. Arma may be a mistake for
arena‘, or else is an interpolation from
armis castrisque supr. The kindly critic
of my Anecdoton in Hermathena xviii
remarked, ‘ we do not think that any future
editor of the pro Milone will read arma.’
I am glad to see that so good a judge as
Dr. Reid has led the way by giving harenam.

3. flammatu ξ 101 n.

in alieno : i. e. the property of another,
so Off. ii. 83. Alienum as a subst. is fre-
quently found, e. g. largiri de. or ex alieno.
For this extended sense cf. Sall. Cat. v. 5
alieni appetens, sui profusus. The owner
might well look on coossy, since what Clo-
dius built would belong to him, as owner
of the soil τ cf. Dig. xli. i. 7. 12 si quis in
alieno solo sua materia aedificaverit, illius
fit aedificium, cuius et solum est [Wirz].

4. oui viro: cf. Phil. xiii. 29 quos
cives, quos viros! Dom. 21, &c. ”

5. Scantia: the name occurs as that
of a Vestal virgin, Tac. Ann. iv. 16.

Ρ. Aponio: Ascon. 55 mentions a
Cn. Aponius as one os the accusers of
Saufeius under the Plotian law, who
may have been a relative of the person
here alluded to. Cicero throughout
dwells upon the seuds of Clodius with
those who are now endeavouring to avenge
his memory, e. g. with Pompey, § 37, &c.,
with Antony‚ § 40, u ith his brother Appius
infr. The name Aponius is not uncommon:
the only Apinius who appears in the Dict.
is Apinius Tiro, Tac. Hist. iii. 57.
