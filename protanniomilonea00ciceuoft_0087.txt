PRO T. ANNIO MILONE. 13

non, etiam si e re publica oppressa sunt, rem publicam tamen

’ · vulnerarunt. Itaque ego ipse decrevi, cum caedem in via Appia 6

factam esse constaret, non eum qui se defendisset, contra rem

publicam fecisse, sed, cum inesset in re vis et insidiae, crimen

· iudicio reservavi, rem notavi. Quodsi per furiosum illum tr.

modo extra ordinem quaereretur. Divisa sententia est postulante

Madvig, since it would require a third
’ . ille before it, cf. 5 70 n. Those editors
ι . who adopt quo either suppose an ellipse
' ⁴²· ,οἱ oppressa sunt after Salurn„ or mark
urhun si ι re p. as a parenthesis. The
, ’ latter is the easier construction.

ι. otim ιι ο :eo ln: ‘even if it were
to the advantage of the State that they
- were crushed! E rep. marks an antithesis
’ to eontra rem p.‚ the phrase being used
adverbially. Dr. Reid quotes for this use
3 de Or. ti..124 multas e re p. seditiones
’ nepe esne factasz The Schol. Bob.
- explains the argument thus: ‘hoc munit

rem p. oppressam, Leg. Agr. ii. 19, Dom.
122, Sest. 81, Phil. xii. 15; rep. oppressa
594, Dom. 2, 26, Sest. 84. Phil. viii. 5.
An optimate orator naturally speaks more
frequently of the State as ‘ crushed by
traitors ’ than of it as ‘ crushing traitors.’
1 now, however, see that the antithesis of
e re p. and contra rem p. is intentional.
So many conjectures have been made

upon this passage that Ι may be pardoned
for mentioning this one.

speaks of one tribune, although we know

’ ¹ At one time 1 thought it probable that
Ἰ the variants pointed to an original reading
J J etiam sa· res p. oppressa non est . . . non

'being omitted suo loco, had been inserted
= before etiam si, an alteration of est to

riom of ns p. cf. 5 65 n. This conjecture
ted to me by the fondness of
γ Cioero for the phrase opprimere rem p„

that Sallust also vetoed the proposal
(Ascon. ad lo'c.). Cf. §5 12, 47.

7. decernebat: on the proposal of
Hortensius. In this case Milo would
have come before a weak jury, and might
have been acquitted: see p. xxv. Fufius
Calenus, the nescio quis of this passage,
was well aware of this, since he had gained
the aequitial of Clodius in B.C. 61 by
similar tactics. Hortensius then ac-
quiesced, thinking that ‘a sword of lead'
would serve to cut his throat,’ Att. i.
16. 2. On this occasion Fufius and Hor-
tensius reversed their former parts, Fufius
urging the extraordinary, and Hortensius
the ordinary method of procedure.

veteribus legibus, cf. ξ 1 3.

8. extra. ordinem: this was usual in
cases tried under the lex Plotia: cf.
Cael. 1, Fam. viii. 8. 1.

divisa nutantia. est ε Ascon. ad loc.
The two sections of the sementia were,
(i) that the acts in question were contra
rem p., (ii) ut extra ordinem [i.e. veteribus
legibus] quaereretur. The veto placed
on (ii) left Pompey free to bring in his
nova lex (Mommsen). An old interpre-
tation was that the two motions were.
(i) ut extra ordinem quaereretur, (ii) ut
veteribus legibus qu. This conflicts with
