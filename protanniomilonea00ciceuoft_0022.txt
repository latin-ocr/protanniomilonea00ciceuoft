his notes as having taken place at about this period. The first persons
condemned according to him ατε-Μίλων ἐπὶ Κλωδίυυ φόνῳ καὶ Γαβίνιος
παρανομίας ὁμοῦ καὶ ἀσεβείας ὅτι χωρὶς ψηφίσματος ἐς Αἴγυπτον μετὰ ᾳτρατιᾶς
ἐσέβαλεν ἀπαγορευόντων τῶν Σιβυλλείων [Le. for maiestas and caerimoniae
violatae] He adds that the goods of Gabinius were also confiscated ζ
(δήμευσις ἦν ἐπὶ τῇ φυγῇ). The facts about Gabinius are well known. He ¹
was first accused of maiestas in 54 and acquitted, mainly in consequence
of Pompey’s exertions, who put pressure upon individual jurymen and ’
threw out hints of a dictatorship ¹. A full account of the trial is given by ι
Dio, from which it appears that the arguments were mainly concerned
with the count of caerimoniae vz‘olalae ². He was then accused of extor-
tion and condemned. That Pompey was no less earnest in his behalf on>
this occasion may be judged from the fact that he forced Cicero to defend
him, a humiliation to which he had previously refused to stoop in face of
the greatest pressure. The hypothesis of Zumpt, who supposes that—as
confiscation of property did not follow in a suit for extortion—he was
again arraigned in his absence upon the charge of impiety‚ and con-⁴
demned, is altogether untenable ³. What motive could Pompey have for ,Ρ
attacking in this vindictive manner his old friend and lieutenant?
I dwell upon these blunders of Appian since there is one strange state· ’
ment of his to which undue credence has been given. vIn describing the
law of Pompey de ambitu, he says that it embraced all offences committed =
since his first consulship in 70; a provision which alarmed Caesar's
friends, who saw in it a menace to him. Mommsen accepts this state· ·
ment without question, as do all the most recent authorities. I regard it..
as very improbable. Asconius says nothing of any such provision. It
is unlikely that Pompey would wish his own dirty linen to be washed in
public. He was himself accustomed to win elections by the methodsv
which Philip of Macedon found irresistible when attacking fortresses,
namely, by the use of his money bags 4. Nor could he have passed such -’
a measure throughx the senate, in which there was no one, not even the*-
honest Cato, whose past career would enable him to throw the first stone ³. =
A still more convincing argument is to be found in the fact that we hear
⁴ os no one tried whose misdeeds went further back into the past than 54.
It is, Ι think, exceedingly doubtful whether any one was tn'ed at all‚'
except for his share in the bribery prevalent in 53 and 52. The cases*
