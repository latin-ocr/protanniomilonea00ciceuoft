132 APPENDIX Π. 3

The suggestion which will naturally present itself to the mind of the ἶ

reader is that in the general anarchy‚ which prevailed at this period, ξ
the election of tribunes had become dislocated, and that the college of j}
tribunes to which Rufus and Plancus belonged came into office early Αἵ
in 53 13.c.‚ going out at the corresponding time in 52. This hypothesis
reconciles at once all the difficulties alluded to. In May or June 52,
Cicero would naturally speak of the multitudo et celebritas mainerum,
Dio may well be correct in placing the trial of the συχνοί after that of
Rufus and Plancus, and Plutarch in representing that the case of
Hypsaeus came after theirs.

It may be asked, ‘ What is meant by the reference to a possible inter-
calation, made by Cicero in the letter previously quoted?¹ In reply
to this, I would point out that Pompey apparently wished to complete
his task by Aug. 1. For this there were two reasons, In the first
place he modelled his conduct upon that of the dictator, who held office ²
for six months only. Secondly‚ it is well known that the last five months
of the year were occupied by ludz'1, during which it was not usual for ,
the courts to sit, although it is true that an exception had been previously
made in trials for vis-². In his wish to complete the trials before August ,
he may have threatened to insert an intercalary month⁸. The autumn
vacation would thereby be delayed, and with it Cicero's visit to his
friend.

1 am well aware that there is a grave constitutional difficulty in the
way of this otherwise simple explanation. Roman law made no pro-
vision in the case of the tribunate corresponding to the interregnum,
which ensued when there were no consuls. It was therefore a heinous
offence plebem sz'ne tribunis· relinquere ⁴. At the same time it is un-
doubted that the meetings of the concilium plebeis, in which the tribunes
were elected, might be broken up by the methods which are so familiar
in connexion with the comitia. The plebeian assembly might be dis· 2
solved if thunder were heard3 an omen which the tribune was bound ⁸
to take due notice of. The tribunes elected might be declared to have

prodigies and omens in these books is highly characteristic of Livy.

⁸ Cf. the very interesting passage, Verr. ii. 129. Verres, by an abuse of the system
of dies ἐξαιρέσιμοι, took a month and a half out of the year at Cephaloedium, so that
the inhabitants afterwards had to insert mensem intercalarium xlv dies longum· ¹
If he could have done this at Rome, expugnasset iste, ut dies xlv inter binos ludos
tolleretur, per quos solos iudicium fieri, posset. This would have been exactly opposite ³

to the course, which, on this hypothesis, Pompey threatened to adopt.
