82 M. TULLI CICERONIS ⁴

ad Castoris, cum gladiis toto foro volitaverunt. Caedi vidistis
populum Romanum, contionem gladiis disturbari, curn audiretur
silentio M. Caelius tr. pl, vir et in re publica fortissimus, in
suscepta causa firmissimus, et bonorum voluntati, auctoritati

singulari divina incredibili fide.

iudices, ut eam misericordiam tribuatis fortissimo viro, quam
ipse non implorat, ego etiam repugnante hoc et imploro et ις

are two divisions not so connected.
Fortuna balances invidia, while the three
adjectives go with fide. The ordinary
method is to connect singulari with
fortuna, since, if it were taken with the
other two adjectives, et would be in-
correctly used before the third, according
to Madvig’s canon; 434.1 and ξ 4 n.
This (i) spoils th'e concinnitas, since
invzffldza ιε overbalanced by fort singulari,

shape of a sickle, affixed to the end of
a strong pole or bearn, which could be
worked by the hand or by machinery, so
as to mow, cut, or pull out ’ [Rich‚ Dict.
Ant.] and it can hardly be supposed that
the rioters rushed about with anything
resembling them. This explanation then
rests upon three improbabilsties, but apart
from this Cicero would hardly have
chosen so obscure a way of saying, that

they ‘tried to barriearle themselves inside
the temple of Castor?

1. volitaverunt : the tables drawn up
by Wiist show that Cicero, in his selection
of syncopated or unsyncopated forms, was
guided by a wish to avoid certain
rhythms: cf. § 56 n. Here vdlitdrunt
would produce the end of an hexameter,
a universally condemned clausula [Quin-
til. ix. 4. 102]. In the only parallel case
which occurs in the speeches examined
by Wiist Cat. i. 14, he would read
cumulavzsti for cumulasti [pp. 72, 73].
Volitare is a word of which Cicero is
very fond. He uses it either to express
rapid motion as here, or in the sense of to
‘ strut,’or ‘ flaunt about.' In this sense it is
often used with in foro or persarum, e.g.
Cat. ii. 5, Dom. 49, Font. 33. See Land-
graf’s excellent note upon Rosc. Am. 1 35.

3. silentio : i. e. there was nothing to
provoke a r'iot. This is very different
from the account in Appian.

3-6. in suscepta. . . . fide: Ι emend
the punctuation of this sentence by omit-
ting et before in susc. (with H), before
auctor. (with Ei, and before incred. (with
Η). This produces three clauses con-
nected by et, while in each clause there

and (ii) Ciceronian usage is in favour of
taking singul. Wlth fide In the speeches
singularis fides occurs six times. so
also Fam. i. 7. 2 and Rep. iii. 27.
The epithet is combined with divinus,
e. g. Div. i. 53 singulari vir ingenio
Aristoteles et paene divino, with in-
credibilis, e.g de Or. iii. 13 ob amorem in
rem p. incredibilia et singularia pertu-
limus, while all three occur together, ib. i.
172 incredibilis et prope singularis et
divina vis ingeni. For the asyndeton
cf. Sest. 85, &c. No parallel is quoted
by editors for fortuna singularis.

5. deditus: the intensive force of de· in
composition enables the positive to follow
the preceding superlatives.

8. orem obtesterque: ‘oro is always
placed before obtestor or obsecro, since the
long er word takes the second place’
[W61ffliu‚ Allit. p. 6.18]

11. exposco: ἅπαξ λε’γ. in Cicero,
whose favourite form is deposco.

nostro omnium fletu: the object
of the epilogus is above everything to
excite tears. To do this the speaker must
first weep himself d'e Or. ii. 196. For
the ridicule exeited by Cicero's ready
tears cf. Plane. 76.
