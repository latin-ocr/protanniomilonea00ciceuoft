16 M. TULLI CICERONIS

cida, si qui consularem patrem, quam si qui humilem necarit,
aut eo mors atrocior erit P. Clodi, quod is in monimentis ma-
iorum suorum sit interfectus; hoc enim abistis saepe dicitur,
proinde quasi Appius ille Caecus viam munierit, non qua po-

in eadem ista Appia cum ornatissimum equitem Romanum P.
Clodius M. Papirium occidisset, non fuit illud facinus poeniendum ;
homo enim nobilis in suis monimentis equitem Romanum
occiderat ; nunc eiusdem Appiae viae nomen quantas tragoedias
excitat! Quae cruentata antea caede honesti atque innocentis 10
viri silebatur, eadem nunc crebro usurpatur, posteaquam latronis

flourish.' So Clu. 31 liberos is used of an
unborn child, and Phil. i. 2 liberos cor-
responds to tuus parvus filius in 31.
Cf. Aul. Gell. ii. 13.

3. sit: the subjunctive is used, since
the words of the accusers are quoted.
Several dett. omit sit, and in one very

1. si qui . . . si qui: see cr. n.
I follow H, since there seems no reason
for reading quis before hum. Reisig says
on Fam. iv. 5. 6 si qui etiam inferis
sensus est, that ‘the hiatus aster qui is
only offensive‚ if i follows.’ Either qui
or quis appears to have been used, accord-

ing to the whim of the writer ε thus Rep.
ii. ch. xxxi the palimpsest gives in two
successive sections ne quis and ne qui
magistratus. That there is no difference
of meaning between the two forms, is the
opinion of the best authorities. Madvig
on de Fin. i. 10 says that ‘ more has been
written on the subject than it deserves‚
and that the safest course is to follow the
best MSS? See also RH. p. 60 and n.
3563 also infr. § 100.

2. monimentis: Brambach, p. 119,
observes that monu- was the archaie form,
while moni· carne in before the Augustan
period, and became traditional in the
schools, thus Priscian says ⁶ moneo, moni-
tus, monz'mentum.' Our MSS. vary in their
spelling; moni· is here given by H, in § 18
by HTE, in § 37 by TE, in § 104 by H.
Itis common in MSS. to find moni· altered
to monu— by the second hand, and the
inconsistency is doubtless due to such
correction.

maiorum: i. c. 'Appius Claudius
Caecus. The plural is used for rhetorical
effect. Landgraf in his valuable note
upon Rosc. Am. 6 quotes W‘cslfflin on
Liv. xxi. 44. 5 tantum itineris per tot
montes fluminaque emensos, ‘where the
plur. flumina can only be referred to the
Ebro, and montes is an empty rhetorical

late MS. est is given, obviously by con-
jecture. The same conjecture occurred
to Madvig, and is approved of by Dr.
Reid.

4. munierit: the same form is given,
Sest. 78, where there is no variant. Cf.
Diomedes, p. 374, 5 'salim perfectum
salii, quasi munii.' The great Caecus is
in Cael. 34 called up to reproach his
descendant Clodia: ‘ ideo viam munivi, ut
eam tu alienis viris comitata celebrares Ζ ’

6. ornatissimum: the epithetis pro-
perly used of those who have held curule
office, but was also extended to equites,
e. g. Clu. 198 equitem Romanum om-
nium ornatissimum.

7. Μ. rapu-ium: see Ascon. on 5 37,
and Dom. 66 for the story.

8. homo: for the idiomatical use of
homo to denote rank or profession, e. g.
homo servuS, homo histrio, or nationality,

e. vg. §80 Graeci homines, see Landgraf .

on Rosc. Am. 8.

nobilis . . . equitem: the terms are
caresully chosen, and the irony increased
by suis. Clodius treats the via Appia as
if it belonged to his family. Cicero thus
rebuts the invidia which the scene of the
murder had created τ cf. Quintil. v. 10. 41
ad invidiam valet (locus) . . . et Miloni
inter cetera obiectum est, &c.
