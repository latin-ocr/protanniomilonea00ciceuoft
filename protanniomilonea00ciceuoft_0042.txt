upon slender evidence. That the pro Mnone was not much read in
the middle ages is clear from a glance at the ancient catalogues pre-
served to us. It only occurs three times in the lists collected by Manitius‚·-
sc. in the catalogues of Lorsch and Cluny. Ξ
Lorsch [cent. ix]. 445. Metrum Tullii Ciceronis (sc. Aratea), orationes
pro Cluentio, pro Milone, in Pisonem, pro Cornelio. ¹ ξ
Cluny [cent. xii]. 41²· Defensio Marci Tullii pro Milone. ib. 496.AE
Cicero pro Milone, et pro Avito, et pro Murena, et pro quibusdam ahis’. Ξ
The fact of its existence at Lorsch in the ninth century is of εοῑῐιθΞ
importance‚ in view of a not improbable conjecture which has been mades' 3
connecting one of our MSS. with that great seat of mediaeval erudition ³.
The MSS. which we now possess are easily classified. They are- j}
(A) P, THE PALIMPSEsTus TAURINENSIS‚ of which only a few fragments?
remain. ’
(B) THE GERMAN MSS„ three in number, sc. H [Harlez'anus 2682]‚-
T[Tegernseenszs], and Erfurlenszs [E]. To these may be added W, the-L
lost Werdensz's.
(C) THE MULTITUDE OF INFERIOR MSS„ chiefly of Italian origin. ,
Of these the last were exclusively used by scholars until 1569, when·
F. Fabricius published a selection of readings from the Werdensz's. Since
then their inferiority, as compared with members of the German familyss
has been increasingly recognised. Baiter says tersely, ‘ interpolatis codz'cz‘busz
Italicis nulla fides haberi polest'; a judgment which will commend itself to,¹
every inquiret. Ι should not linger over them, but for the singular occur-¹3

authority, without, so far as I am aware, any sufficient inquiry having}
been made into its pedigree. Thus Richter, a very acute critic, pays).
great regard to s, and considers the readings of H due to conjecture,{
unless supported by il, a view ingeniously perverse. Also in my Anecdoton
I spoke of it as a late descendant of H, a Judgment which 1 now retract.
In order to realise the position of s, it is necessary to discuss the}
affinities of the deteriores. As the result is an important one, I may be
pardoned for going into some detail. The best known members of this
very large family are— ⁷

¹ A full collation of this MS. would be os interest, as it must be one of the earliest

dett. The select readings given in Nohl' s notes do not, however, show any deviations.
