⁷ tre accepted, the trial should extend over five days.
ξ In' the account os what actually took place, however, we find only four
‘'l“ days mentioned. Asconius is here perfectly explicit. He says primo die
¹ j thelewas a riot, then per biduum the witnesses were heard in silence,
3 then postero die, qui fuit iudici summus, came the sortitio iudicum and
Ὗ the pleading (Ascon. 41). At the end of the third day a contio was
ξ afflressed by Plancus, who urged the multitude to attend postero die, and
Ξ intimidate the jury. This contio, he says elsewhere (on ξ 71), was held
ἐ post audura et obszggnata testeiam verba, and Cicero in the speech also calls
1· it hesma contio (ξ 3).
ζ’ ν The language of Asconius is less clear when he is giving the contents
d the law (ib. 4ο). He says there that it was ordained that the witnesses
³ss ¹ should be heard per triduum, then quarta die adesse omnes in diem posterum
--ἒ haberentur ac . . . pilae . . . aequarentur, dein rursus postero dz'e sortitio
‚3 feret, διο. and the final hearing should take place. The old interpre-
ἶ astion of this passage was that ‘ on the fourth day the jurors should
be ordered to assemble on the following, i.e. the fifth, day, and the
ἓ ,θερωίώ pilorum should take place. Then on the following, i.e. the fifth,
. ἲ day the pleadings were to ensue.'
{5 Some editors, accepting this scheme, suppose that the fourth day of
1¹ the trial was practically ‘ a blank day‚' nothing taking place in it beyond
*ξ the aequatio pilorum. A fatal objection to this is that in this case the
,Ἓξ speech of Plancus, which came immediately after the hearing of the
3 evidence, would have been not on the eve of the summus dies, as is
}} repeatedly asserted, but of the day before it. Also it does not agree
-ἷᾈ with the Subsequent account, where only four days are mentioned.
