M. TULLI CICERONIS

quorum utrique mortem est minitatus, nisi sibi hortorum pos-
sessione cessissent), sed ausum esse T. Furfanio dicere, si sibi
pecuniam, quantam posceret, non dedisset, mortuum se in domum
eius illaturum, qua invidia huic esset tali viro conflagrandum ;
qui Appium fratrem, hominem mihi coniunctum fidissima gratia, 5
absentem de possessione fundi deiecit, qui parietem sic per
vestibulum sororis instituit ducere, sic agere fundamenta, ut
sororem non modo vestibulo privaret, sed omni aditu et lumine.

1 . minatus H.
m

Richt.: ausum esset H: ausus esse P; ausus esset E; ausum esse Τδ.
3. posceret H: poposcerat rell.

HE& : Furfanium T ; furz'ofiznio P.

quia H. 8. lumine H: limine rell.

1. minitatus: minari and minitari
frequently occur as variants, e. g. Cat. ii.
1, iv. 20. Merguet gives four other
references for mortem minitari. In
defenee of minari it might be urged that
a single threat would be enough for
a ‘ weak woman,' and a stripling.

2. cessissent: ‘the plur. is found in
subordinate propositions‚ with reference to
the individuals, which are denoted in the
leading proposition by a collective word,'
Madv. 215 a, obs.: cf. Fin. ii. 1 cum
uterque me intueretur, seseque ad audien-
dum sigyzfficczrent paratos. Ι formerly
—Anecd. pp. xli and 39-err0neously at-
tributed cessisset *to H.

ausum esse “.ῑ“.; for adiscussion of the
reading see p. xliv.

3. posceret: ef. Verr. iii. 25 ego
tantum dem, quantum ille poposcerit?
poscet omne, quantum exaravero: ib. 29
licentia permissa, ut tantum ab aratore,
quantum poposcisset, auferret. The sub-
junctive makes the demand of Clodius
more outrageous. He says, ‘si mihi pe-
cuniam, quantam poposcero, non dederis.’
The indic. would limit the demand to
a definite amount. Dr. Reid, who keeps
the indic„ remarks that the subjunctive
would be more usual, but does not notice
the reading of H.

mortuum: i. e. ⁴ a corpse.‘ N'agelsb.
ξ 28. 4 says that it is the only perf. pass.
partic. which Cicero uses in the masc. as
a substantive. Cf. Rep. ii. 61 L. Sestium,
cuius in cubiculo ecfossum esse se prae-
sente mortuum diceret.

4. huic . . . tali: so bos tales viros,
Div. in Caec. 51 hitales viri, Clu. 186, &c-
ἓίοεῑο also says hic et talis, e.g. Har.

5. mihi coniunctum: he was recon—
ciled to Cicero (cf. § 39 n.) through the
mediation of Pompey [Quintil. ix. 3. 4IJ,
and as consul treated him with distinction.
He was now absent in Cilicia. Cicero,
who succeeded him there, made great
efforts to keep up his friendship with him,
though in confidential letters he speaks of
his exactions in very plain tems—monstra
quaedam non hominis, sed serae nescio
cuius immanis: Att. v. 16. 11. Appius
has gone down to posterity as the only
augur who took his art seriously, Div. i.
105. He was also a necromancer, ib. 132.
He dedicated the first book of his work
on augury to Cicero, Fam. ii. 13. 2.

6. deiecit : ‘ evieted‚' t. t.‚ cf. Caecin. '
ch. xxviii sq.

7. sororis: the famous βοῶπις-[ς 73 n.'J,
who is called ¹ Palatina Medea ’ Cael. 18.
Her husband, Metellus Celer, had a house
on the Palatine, and she continued to live
there after his death. Her house touched
on one side that of Catulus [Cael. 59],
while it seems from this passage that
Clodius lived next to her on the other
side. From Har. Resp. 33 ne quis

&c., it would appear that Cicero was his
neighbour. The great house of Scaurus,
which Clodius bought in 53 [Aseon. 33],
was also on the Palatine, while Caelius
rented chambers in an insula belonging to
Cglpdius in the same neighbourhood [Cael.

8. vestibulo: i. e. the courtyard.
Aul. Gell. xvi. 5 quotes C. Aelius Gallus
[circ. 50 B.c.]' as saying in his book de
stgvmjfic. verb. that vestibulum is, ‘ non in
ipsis aedibus, neque partem aedium, sed
locum ante ianuam domus vacuum, per
quem a via aditus accessusque ad aedes
