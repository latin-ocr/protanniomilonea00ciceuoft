lvi PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

The argument is wound up by a spirited appeal to Pompey‚ ἕξ 672—71
[ἀποστροφή or aversus α iudice sermo] ¹, to save an old friend, whom he
may some day need. Pompey’s face is supposed to change3 a cry of
triumph breaks forth from the advocate, and the first part of the defence
is ended.

Cicero now passes from the conslz‘lutzb z'urzdz'cz‘alzlr absoluta, and oecupies
his second line of defence. ·

(v) Pars adsumptiva, or extra oausam ἕξ 72—91.

This is resorted to when it is necessary to strengthen the defence by
a fresh argument ². In the pars absoluta Cicero argued iure ficit: in
the pars adsumptiva the position is ‘ even if Milo did murder Clodius, still
we must consider the circumstances which qualify the act.’ various
methods of conducting such a defence are prescribed by the text-books ³.
The one chosen by Cicero is that termed ἀντίστασις, comparatio, or compen-
satz'o 4. In this the act is acknowledged, but it is urged that 'theibenefit to
the state outweighs the offenee. Cicero probably treats the question
from this point of view out of rivalry with Brutus, whose pamphlet had
been entirely based on this argument. He saw, however, that the position
could not be maintained, and therefore soon shifts his ground, ἕξ 83-93,
and declares that it was Providence which was at work, so that Milo
cannot claim the glory.

If Milo were to tell a ‘ magnificent lie,’ and say, ‘ Ι (Ῑί(1 the deed,' he
would be justified in having slain one who in the past had assailed all
members of the community‚ not sparing his own kin, and in the future
menaced every interest. If it were possible for Clodius to rise from the
dead, everyone would shrink with horror from the prospect, and Pompey
would himself refuse to call him forth.'

Milo, however, does not claim the glory. It was Heaven that tempted
Clodius to his fall, and it was before the shrine of the Goddess whom he
had outraged that he received the fatal blow. But for the interposition
of Providence, ruin final and complete must have ensued.

The object of the pars adsumptiva has been to kindle the jurors to
