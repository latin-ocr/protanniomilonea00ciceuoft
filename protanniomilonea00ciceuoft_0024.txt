xiv PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

If the preceding remarks are correct, there is no evidence that any one
was prosecuted except those persons directly implicated in the events of
53 and 52. If, however, the statements of Appian are upheld, it still „
remains that we know of no one who was tried for misdeeds further back j

than 54. There 1s nothing' in the record of cases to justify the statement, 1

that the retrospective action of the law extended to 70. .
The mistake probably arose in the following manner. The law of·¹
Pompey was criticized at the time as being retrospective. Thus Cato ;
urged ‘let byegones be byegones¹.'' Later writers, wishing to explain ·
‘retrospective,’ fixed the second consulship of Pompey in 55 as the ‚¹-
limit2. Appian first of all confused the second consulship with the first, ⁴
and then proceeded to invent the story that the measure was aimed Ι
at Caesar, and that the friends of the latter protested against such an ’

action. If so, this, in connexion with his other blunders, throws a curious ²
light upon his methods as a historian.

II. HISTORICAL INTRoDUCT1oN.

The severish anai-chy which prevailed at Rome throughout this period
was without doubt the most significant of the many alarming symptorns
which pointed to the speedy dissolution of the Republican system. The
maintenance of public order was entirely neglected by the state, or
rather was not recognized as a matter which concerned the executive.
The individua] had to take the law into his own hands. A Roman built
his house to stand a siege, and when he went about the streets was
accompanied by an armed retinue. The magistrates, so far from
endeavouring to suppress disorder, were themselves the chief offenders,
the problem for the ‘ practical politician' of the day being how to hold
the place of assembly against his rivals, while his hired gangs met in the
name of the Roman people, and made binding throughout the civilized
world any proposal, however mad or flagitious, which he cared to bring
forward. The leading part in this carnival of misrule naturally fell to
the tribune, who, in virtue of the sanctity of his person, enjoyed the
singular privilege of being able to assault any other magistrate, while the
injured person was unable to retaliate.

Under these circumstances rioting became chronic at Rome. In
a well-known passage ³ Cicero describes a memorable party-fight, which r

μεγάλας τοῦ Πομπηίου νομοθετοῦντος.
