1. inczpit H post lac. in voc. terfici [sz‘c]. 3. cum hoc: det. Garatoni.
mulcatus H: multatus ΤΕδ. 4. sica, illa quam Richter. 5. intenta
H, Ascon. in lemmate, eiusdem in scholio codd. SM.: intentata T Εδ. 6. obici
vos Ascon. - passus non sum, Ascon. in lemmate, scd in scholio, non sum passus.
7. viam Appiam, Ascon. ι ista viam Appiam H; istam Appiam ΤΕδ.

2. turba. : frequently used of a rior, 5. a. catfflna. accepera: cf. ξ 55
e. g. Q. F. ii. 3. 2 nos quoque turn fugimus, with the note of Asconius. In Att. i. ¹4·
ng quid in turba, ’ 5, Cicero calls the friends of Clodius grex

c. Vibienus : this passage is irrecon- Catilinae, and Pis. 2 3 descxiboe Clodius as

cileable with the MSS. reading in Ascon.
33 compluresque noti homines elisi sunt,
inter quos C. Vibienus senator, i. e. in the
riot after Clodius’ death. Various sug-
gestions have been made. Halm thinks
that Cicero made a mistake. Such a
blunder, however, is hardly credible‚ and
Asconius, who is so much interested in
the accuracy of Cicero, could not have
failed to point it out. Kraffert boldly
brackets qua in . . . amiserit, as inter-
polated from Asconius! Wirz more sen-
sibly suggests, that the words in Asconius,
inter quos C. Vz‘h. senator, are interpo-
lated from this passage, a view which to
my mind is verified by the conjecture of
Rinkes, who emends in Ascon. visi for
elisi (omitting inter . . . senator), and
thus improves the meaning in Asconius,
and removes the contradiction between
him and Cicero.

3. vir optimus: cf. ξ 21 n.

cum hoc cum esset: Garatoni was
struck by the inelegance os the re-
peated cnm, and thought that cum hoc
was an addition. Cf. §48 una fui [cum
Clodio] n. There is, however, no variety
in our MSS. ‚ and that Cicero's ears did
not object to the repetition, may be seen
from Reid on Sull. 16, and Tyrrell on
Fam. ix. 6. 3.

mulcatus: the only other reference for
this verb in the speeches is Verr. iv. 94,
where also it is misspelt [sc. mult.‚ or
mulct.] except in the best MSS.

4. amiserit: see Madv. 382, obs. 1,
RH. p. 424 sq. for the tense.

Catilinae praevaricatore quondam, tum
ultore. The charge shows some ingrati-
tude, since during the conspiracy Clodius
was one of Cicero's body-guard! [Plut.
Cic. 29.] Drumann (ii. 277) strangely
says ‘man entriss ihtn den Dolch, an-
geblich ein Geschenk Catilinas: apparently
taking the words literally of an actual
resent!

p intenta: ‘ pointed at‚’ cf.. Pis. 5 tela
intenta iugulis, Har. Resp. 7 si quod in
me telum intenderit, &c. The variant
intentata would = ‘brandished,’ cf. Rosc,
Am. 101 volumen intentasse et minitatum,
a reference which 1 owe to Mr. Poynton.
Merguet gives no other quotation for
intentare in the speeches besides the
present passage. For the corruption cf.
ξ 24 tracta [tractata codd.]; so ξ 67
sor intenta ᾳ gives intentata. The editors
of Asconius have corrupted his text by
printing intentata, although intenta is
vouched for in his lemma by allthree of
the chief MSS„ and in the scholium by
the two best of them.

6. obit-,1 pro me . . . iudd- rampeio:
see Ascon. ad loc.

7. viam Appiam: I read with As-
conius. Istam appears to be an ad·
dition‚ which is combined with viam
in H, and has expelled it in the other

sui: ‘so used as if the subject of the
sentence was Clodius sicarius, instead of
sz'ca’ [Halm]. Cf. §84 n.

Papiri: Ascon. 1. c.‚ and ᾗ 18 supr.
