j IV. THE STYLE AND CoMP051T1oN or THE SPEECH.

., The M'lom'ana belongs to the third or most finished period in the
. development of Cicero's style. As is well known, at the beginning of his
career he had shown an inclination towards the Asiatic school of orators3
{34⁸ tendency usually ascribed to the influence exercised upon him by
’ Hortensius ¹. The characteristics of these writers were a perpetual
struggling after effect, and an excessive fondness sor decoration, mani-

3 festing themselves in elaborate periods, in rhythms repeated until they
{¹became wearisome‚ in ceaseless assonances and alliterations, in collocations
words so artificial that the art became apparent2. The chief examples
{ff this first manner of Cicero are the pro Quinctio and pro Sex. Roscio
ἶ ιι* 'no. He was cured of this tendency by his soj’ourn in Rhodes,

{there he studied under Molon‚ who ‘penned within its banks' 3 the
*ᾗρνεῐᾱοννίιιε stream of his youthful eloquence. It is customary to assign
,ἴδε name of Rhodian to his second style, that in which most of his
³ ..pecches are written, this being a compromise between the luxuriance of
⁴ the Asiatica and the simplicity of the strictest Attic writers. This eclectic
ἦμγὶε, however, was in character more nearly related to the Asiatic than to
ᾖε Attic⁴. At this time the younger writers in Rome were thorough-

going Atticists, and selected Ly sias especially as their model⁶. The
101er of Cicero himself was steadily developing in the> direction of greater
5 dmplicity, and he now disputes with his opponents the right to call
