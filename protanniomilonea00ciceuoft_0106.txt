32 M. TULLI CICERONIS

Non modo igitur nihil prodest, sed obest etiam Clodi mors
Miloni.

‘At valuit odium, fecit iratus, fecit inimicus, fuit ultor in-
iuriae, poenitor doloris sui.'

Quid? si haec non dico maiora ’

fuerunt in Clodio quam in Milone, sed in illo maxima, nulla in 5

hoc, quid vultis amplius? Quid enim odisset Clodium Milo, se-
getem ac materiam suae gloriae, praeter hoc civile odium, quo
omnes improbos odimus? Illi erat, ut odisset primum defensorem
salutis meae, deinde vexatorem furoris, domitorem armorum

suorum, postremo etiam accusatorem suum. Quo tandem animo 10

the only exception to this rule being with
fieri, which is treated as a deponent, and
not as a passive, e. g. Brut. 106 plura fierz

coepzsse in a transitive sense see 5 95 n.

. obest: cf. Off. i. 42,

8. uli erat, ut odisset: ’ erat ut is
probably used for erat cur, cf. Cael. 14
est, ut ipse moleste ferat errasse se. The
emendation which I offer is a simple one,
since i and e are continually confused, and
removes the hyperbaton of ille, which does
not seem to me Ciceronian. [The same
suspicion has occurred to N ovak‚who says,
‘sort. illi erat.’] If ille is retained, it is

1. prodest . .
ii. 72. 86.

4. poenitor: Cicero apparently coined
the substantive to serve as a synonym for
ultor, a sense in which it was afterwards

employed by Val. Max. iii. 4. 5. In
Suet. Caes. 67 it=‘punisber.'

6. segetem: εί Quintil. viii. 6. 7 for
the metaphor.

7. materiam : Zumpt laid down the rule
that in this and similar forms, e.g. luxuria,
-es‚ barbaria, -es, Cicero preferred the
fifth decl. in the nom. (and acc.), and
the first decl. in the oblique cases [on
Verr. ii. 7]. His canon however is not
always borne out by the MSS., cf. Madvig,
clear that the variants are often due to
a corrector, e. g. F lace 5, the Schol gives

luxuriam, i. e. luxurss, so Verr. v 137, R

gives luxur‘mae 1. e luxurie} The rule of
Fronto, de diff voc, [Keil, vii. 531] ‘ma-
teries animi est, materia a1·boris‚’ is, at
agry ffltSeSin (ἓξ-ξω, in flatgcontxrladiction to
e . rea lngs, e. g. 74, err. 1. 147,
v. 47, &c. Indeed in the sense of ‘ timber’
he seems to have preferred materies.
odium quo odimus: for the etymo-
logical abl. cf. Catull. xiv. 3, Liv. ii. 58. 5
and the very valuable dissertation of Land-
graf, de figura etym. [Act. Erl. ii. p. 31.]

put in the front of the sentence for em-
phasis. Another explanation of the pas·
sage is that ille erat ut odisset is a
periphrasis for ille oderat, ‘it was a fact
that' [Wirzl. Cf. Orat. 199 est autem,ut
id maxime debeat, non ut solum.
ιο. accusatorem suum: Milo aceused
Clodius de vi twice, ξ 39. The addition
reus enim . . . quoad vixit was con-
demned by Bake as bad Latin, apparently
on account of the strange expression
reus Mz'stlonzs for which, however, Reid
quotes Verr. A. P. 6 reum suum, and
Hor. Sat. ii. 4 3 Anyti reum (for reus
lege Plotia cf. Madv. Ep. Cr. p. 52 on reus
lege Cornelia, &c.). The sense of the
words is somewhat dark. Zumpt, p.
513, is generally referred to. He says
‘the statement is somewhat unusual, as
the case was also unusual. The sense is
that Clodius, so long as he lived, was not
iacquitted of the chdarcgie. 'iiie suit against
rm was never en e .' ⁹ e sentence is
far more Ciceronian, when this very inept
gloss is exeised. For the structure cp.
ξ 58 conservatores domini, ultores sceleris,
defi-mores neeis, Sest. 125 Ubi erant tum
illi contionum moderatores, legum domini,
civium expulsores?
