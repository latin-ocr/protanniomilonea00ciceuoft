ε ἢ the books · as to the conduct of a causa com'ecturalz's are strictly
Ᾱ-ἰε *ved ¹.

, (iv) Tractatio: ξς 32—71.

The parts of this are probabile, collatio, signa, argumenta, consecutio,
‘mrobatia The probabile falls into two parts, sc. ex causa, and ex vita.
'sonnatio’ is the process of showing how the allegations fit, or do not fit,
sibe person aecused, Signa and argumenta are proofs taken from the
place and time, ἀς. of the deed. Consecutio ³ refers to the behaviour
J nf=the accused after the deed: and approbata* to rhetorical common-
-ῴὶαοοε, used after the suspicion has become a certainty: such communes
{latiare e. g. for or against attaching credence to rumours, or to the
fiffldence of slaves taken under torture. In this speech one of these loci
,sspaereoedes and another comes after the consecutio, thus giving variety to the
composition, which hitherto had been perfectly regular.

1. Paommu.

(a) Ex causa ἕξ 32-34. This he examines first in the case of Clodius,
·. ἶὶικί then in that of Milo. The argument proceeds by the usual steps ⁵.
&ln thecase of Clodius we have, (1) the propositio, that he hoped to profit
¹ &Milo’s death ; (2) the ratio, that bad men are tempted even by a trifling
ἐιίιη (3) the confirmatio, that, if Milo were killed, Clodius would control
fifthe consuls 3 (4) a striking exornatio, in the shape of a dramatic appeal to
»sextus Clodius to produce his portfolio of laws. The fifth part of the
argmnent, sc. the complexio, is omitted according to a frequent practice ⁶.
{flThe same method is then applied to Milo's case, and in this case the
v ‘argument is wound up by a complexio, or rei-um! (itaque Milonis . . . mors
, Miloni). To this succeeds the collatio. All the incentives were present
--Ῑ h the case of Clodius, and absent in that os Milo, ξ 35.

(b) Ex vita §§ 36-41. First to take the life of Clodius, and then that
d Milo. Clodius had used violence against Cicero, Pompey, and others.
, ‘The dagger he inherited from Catiline had never rested.’ Milo only

§need violence after he could not get a legal remedy, and then only in the
