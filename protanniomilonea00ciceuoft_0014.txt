iv PREFACE.

which had been screened off from the view of the reader. This
is doubtless due to the fact that for generations the Miloniana
has been extensively read in schools. A work chiefly meant
for youthsul students must above all things be simple, and to
secure this result editors have frequently been content to let
sleeping difficulties lie. The criticism of a school-book naturally
tends to become stereotyped. This is especially the case when
the book is frequently re-edited, the plausible conjecture of
one writer being accepted without inquiry by his successors.
The fact, however, that an explanation has been many times
reprinted does not confer any sanctity upon it, and it is in the
interest of scholarship that from time to time tradition should
be called in question. Ι have therefore also ventured to add
explanatory notes, in writing which I have always used my own
judgment, even if this sometimes ran counter to received opinion.
Ihave, of course, studied with diligence the many excellent
commentaries which have appeared. Much hasbeen said upon
the text by Garatoni and upon the subject-matter by Osen-
briiggen-Wir2‚ which no one can either omit or improve upon.
The editions of Halm and Richter-Eberhard, primarily meant
for schools, are models of good sense and precision.

I have drawn largely from numerous works which have
appeared in recent years. To Dr. Landgraf my obligations
are very great. His well-known edition of the pro Sexto Roscio
Amerino is indispensable to the student of Cicero. Ι quote
from this so frequently, that Ι deem it proper here to acknow‘-
ledge my debt to him. I have also derived great help from
the new edition of Reiszgg-Haase's Vorlesungen, by Landgraf and
Schmaltz‚ which I have found a storehouse of information-
The new edition of K rebs-Alssrayer's Antibarbarus, by Dr.
Schmaltz‚ is another work from which I have frequently
borrowed. Among English writers 1 have learnt most from
Messrs. Tyrrell and Purser, whose edition of the Letters has
done so much to stimulate the study of Cicero in this country,
and from the various works of Dr. Reid,'more especially his
edition of the Academics.
