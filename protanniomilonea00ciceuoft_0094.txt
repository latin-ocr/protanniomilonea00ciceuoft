a law de libertinorum szffragiis. This
he carried on the day of the Compitalia
(ib. 655, which we know from Dio was
on Dec. 31 <Dio C. xxxvi. 255. It was
afterwards quashed by the senate on the
ground of insci-mality (Asc. 66). As·
conius, in his note upon the present
passage, says that the vigour shown by
Domitius in quaestura (Manutius : prae-
tura MSS.) is referred to, when he opposed
the law os Manilius de libert. suffragiis.
. In 67 13.C. Domitius would be 31 years
of age, and the phrase iam ab adulesc.
is appropriate to events of 15 years
ago. We hear from Asconius of another
riot in which Manilius was concerned
early in 65 B.C., when he was being
tried sor maiestas ζ in Cornel. 60, 66), and
the Schol. Bob. on this passage says the
reference is to the behaviour of Domitius
then. It is possible that Domitius took
the lead on both occasions, but more
likely that the Scholiast has fused together
the two riots mentioned by Asconius. The
correction of Manutius is of the most
simple kind <see C. F. W. Miiller's notes,
ii. 3, on pp. 35. 6, 6. 22, 241. 30 for errors
due to the abbreviations q.= quaestor,
and pn: praetor), and has been accepted
by Garatoni, and Nipperdey (leges an-
nales, pp. 85, 86). I would point out that
Domitius, who should have been consul
suo anno in 55, aud was praetor in 58,
would, if quaestor suo annm-which he
certainly must have been, since he had

been ⁴ designated for the consulship since .

his cradle,' Att. iv. 8 b. 2‚—hold the office
in 67: which seems to verify the correc—
tion.

Recent editors all keep praetura in the
text of Ascon.‚ and refer to events sup-
posed to have taken place in 58 B.C.,
a course which plunges them in a morass
of difficulties. It is conjectured (i) that
an otherwise unknown Manlius (the MSS.

ofAscon. vary between this and Manilius)
in 58 proposed again the law which Mani-
lius had brought sorward in 67, and was
opposed by Domitius [Wirz‚ Gaumitz].
It is, however, highly improbable that
two persons, with such similar names,
would have brought forward the same
law; (ii) that the same Manilius in 58
again advocated his old law of 67 [Halm,
Richt-Eb.]. But the words of Asconius
can only mean that he was tribune at the
time, and to render C. Manilius tr. pl.
by ‘C. Man. the wellknown tribune of
66 ’ does not seem ingenuous. Also. it is
difficult to see what his locus standi could
have been, since no one supposes he was
again tribune. He disappears from history
aster his condemnation sor maiestas in 65,
having previously been aeeused os κλοπή
at the end of 66 [Dio C. xxxvi. 2 5]. Both
explanations ignore the support given to
the earlier date, sc. 67-66, by the Schol.
Bob., while iam ab adulescentia hardly
describes the events of six years ago.
Some wilder theories are to be found in
Gaumitz, p. 28. .
