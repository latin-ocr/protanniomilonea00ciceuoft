z'llz'. Ι myself hold that illa, which P inserts sol. in the next line after tua,
is due to a dislocation of illi here. In § 31 P gives si sor sin, wrongly.

In §88 Nohl himself surrenders obstare poterat, so P, for the more
forcible poterat obstare found in the other MSS. In ξ 73. implerunt seems
preferable to the unsyncopated form given by P sol. I do not mention>
ordinary corruptions such as § 35. lege Plotia: lege P. Clodi, P. since
these are bound to occur in the best MSS. I would, however, draw
special attention to the two following cases :—‹ ι

§74 hunc P. Varium: P, according to Zuretti, gives hunc C. or
Τ. Varium, not P. Varium as reported in Baiter. H has hunc p. Varum3 ,ἶ
ΤΕ give hunc c. p. Varium, blending two original variants, sc. C. (as ’
probably in P) and P. as in H ¹.

§75. ausum esse T. Furfanio: so Richter from MSS. indications.
His restoration is confirmed by H, ausum esset Furfiznt'o. P has ausus
esse Fusf, omitting the praenomen ; T, ausum esse Furf, following the
second hand' 1n P; and E, ausus esset Furf, a blend of P1 and H. Here
P appears to be the fons corruptionis in TE, while H preserves the
genuine reading' 1n an unintelligible form.

These instances will show that the question cannot be settled by an
appeal to age or authority, but that the variants of H against P are
entitled to be considered upon their merits. The fact is that we have
not enough of P to justify us in ascribing extreme value to it, and
1 suspect that if we possessed more of it, we should find along with good ¹
readings a number of errors common to T. It is a well-known phe-
nomenon for a palimpsest to incline towards the vulgar family. Instances
will suggest themselves to every critic. I will only refer to the Vatican
palimpsest of the Verrines, which competent scholars consider inferior
to the Regius Paris. 7774 A [xth cent.] ². If only a few sections
of this had survived, it would have been natural to assign overwhehning
importance to its readingS‚ in which case very misleading conclusions J
as to the authority of the various MSS. would have been drawn-

In the present case it is well to be cautious as P is so scanty. There ’
are certain errors in tenth-or eleventh—century MSS. which can reasonably
be ascribed to the ignorance of copyistS. On the other hand, there are
variants so striking that they can only be looked upon as ultimate
differences in the recension, e. g. if in § 14 P gives arma as against ’

¹ The development of this corruption in later MSS. is interesting: σ gives hunc ἶ
C. Publium vitum, and the fifteenth—century dett. e.g. ς, hunc Cn. Pompeium virum,
‘ Varium ’ being expelled.
