xlii PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

  

The result of this analysis is strictly in accordance with the gene
character of E, and will surprise no scholar who has studied its readin
in works for which we have superior MSS. evidence, e. g. in thq
Cato Maior, or haelius, where the contaminated character of its recend
sion is notorious ¹. The position ascribed to it above is analogous td
that which it occupies, e. g. in the pro Rege Deiotaro, where it repre-3}
sents a cross between the Ambrosianus and the Gudianus, or betwee1i3
the two recensions in H ². J

Further, that E is in some places directly dependent upon H, the oldeizff
. MS„ has already been proved. Thus the Verrine excerpts found in both}
MSS. were copied into E, or an ancestor of E, from H. This is ind
disputable as a large omission in E occupies exactly one line in Hq
Also, in these all the alterations of the second hand are followed by ΕΞ
Agant, both MSS. give a curious mediaeval Introduction to the pro}
Milone. This in H is out of place, being put before the Verrine excerpts}
which follow without any mark of separation. In E it is given in τῇ
margin at the beginning of the pro Milone, and the alterations of t
second hand in H reproduced. Other points of contact are i'n the fou
speech against Catiline‚ where the superscriptions in E are taken from Hs}
and in the speeches before Caesar, where they come from the duplicate*
or inferior recension contained in H ⁴. In view of these ascertained facts
the theory that the ancestor of E has in this speech been corrected‘sro Α
Η cannot be called improbable. ; ὲ

We are thus left with the two eleventh-century MSS. H and T, the}
latter representing the deterior and the former the melior fhmilz'a. Isi
possibleto further simplify the problem by referring thern to a commog]
source? If this can be done the critic will be able to work more boldlyffi
in the revision of the text than if they are independeng since in the latteffi
case the likelihood of a corruption having occupied both recensions h ⁴
always to be considered. The difference between the two MSS. is certain}
very great, as the figures already given show. Also H has a large lacu
from §§ 18—37 peculiar to itself⁵. The fact that the same corruptio J
are often found in both MSS. does not prove much, since it cannot
doubted that the process of correcting and with it of corrupting MS ’
