lii PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

Pompey has done nothing except order an enquiry. He did this, not
because the death of Clodius differed from that of other men, but in
order to show his own impartiality. He has shown the verdict he desires
by putting in the box the strongest men in Rome, and Domitius himself
on the bench [ἕξ 15-22].

After thus clea1·ing the ground-he proceeds to state the facts:—

(iii) Narratio: §§ 24-29.

In this three things are necessary: ‘ut brevis, ut dilucida, ut veri
similis sit ¹.’ Further it should be told in such a way as to suggest the
points afterwards taken up in the tractatio ².

The narratio here is : (α) brevis, since Cicero plunges into the subJect,
and uses all possible compression; (b) dilucida, since he observes the
proper sequence of events 3 (c) verz' similis, as a model of artful simplicity⁸.
The language employed is that of good conversation, never attempting to
soar, but neither vulgar, nor bald ⁴.

The rule that it should suggest the points afterwards argued is strictly
observed: thus ἕξ 24-2 6, describing the projects and character of Clodius,
correspond to ἕξ 32-43, containing the probabile ex causa and ex vita,
while ἕξ 27-29‚ with their artful references to the place, the time, and
the occasion of the murder, anticipate the argument from the szgrna in
ἓξ 44-56-

The narratio leads to the constitutio causae, §§ 30, 31. Was Milo
right or wrong in killing Clodius? This depends upon the antecedent
question, uter utri 2‘nsz'dias fecerit. The accuser says it was Milo, and
the defender‚ Clodius. The conflict of these two statements gives us the
point at issue, rem quae z'n iudicium venit ⁵.

It was usual to state the point at issue earlier in a speech; but Cicero
postponed it to the narrabo, since the defence depends upon the colour
given to the facts. The line to be followed was only indicated in ἕξ 6
and 23, but now is definitely adopted. As a question of fact is at issue,
the character of the arguments is changed. To use' technical language,
although the status of the case is z'urzdztz'alzzv, sc. iure an iniuria occiderit
lllz'lo Clodium, the constitutio causae is conz‘ecturalzk‘. The rules laid down
