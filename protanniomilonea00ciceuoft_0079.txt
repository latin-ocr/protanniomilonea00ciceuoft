4. cuneus: i. e. senators, equites,
and trib. aerarii, the latter representing
the less privileged classes of the com-

is pointed to by the corruption in H; but
the variant, sc. coniunctus for cunctus, is
not an uncommon one, cf. Verr. iv. 145.

deprecatio, which is hardly appropriate in
judicial proceedings, ad Herenn. i. 24.
These form his second line of desence,
extra causam. In ἐξ 73-83 he argues
the ease after the manner of Brutus, aud
in ξς 83- 91 takes up the point suggested
