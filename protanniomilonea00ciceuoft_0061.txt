ἶ *vehere the speaker calls attention to the unusual circumstances attending
triah cf. the pro Rab. Perd. and pro Rege Deiotaro. After first-
(a) Securing the attention of the jurors, Cicero makes every effort to
ι (b) Their good-will. This 1s done according to rule¹ .
(ι) Α sua persona: ξ 1, sc. his own fears.
(2) Ab auditorum p.: ἕξ 2, 3, sc. Pompey, the army and the
, ” multitude.
‚ss .1⁷‘·“ (3) Ab adversariorum p.: ξ 3, the character of the Clodiani.
· , (4) Α rebus ipris: ἕξ 4, 5, the patriotic policy of Milo, with whom
, ,, Cicero associates himself.
2³³³ (c) He then rapidly sketches the summa causae, in order to secure the
‘5¹’th of his hearers· namely, insidias ᾹΙίΙοηι α Clodio saclas
Ῐῖὲ - Before, however, entering into a discussion of the facts it is necessary to
remove three suppositions fatal to his client. ²
⁷ ’ (ii) Praeiudioia.
(a) ‘The sels· confessed shedder of blood is condemned already!
’ἱ This‘ is not so, since homicide is sometimes justifiable³: as is shown
<a -1-11
v (1) From legend, the story of Horatius.
ο (a) From history, the execution of conspirators.

(3) From fiction, the murder of his mother by Orestes.

(4) From recent events, the story of the soldier who killed his

oflicer.

(5) From the unwritten law of nature, and the written law of man,
‚ which sanction homicide in self—defence.
' (b) ‘ The senate has decided that the murder was contra rempublicam!
³ Thai it did not thereby show itself hostile to Milo is proved out of the
j ‘'accusers’ own mouths, since they complain that the senate merely acts to
,Η register the wishes of Cicero. All violence in a free state is contra remp„
‘J' even violence in the cause of order. The senate agreed with Cicero in
⁷ wishing sor an enquiry into the facts, but did not contemplate these novel
< fprooeedings [ἕξ 12-14].
(c) ⁶ Pompey has condemned Milo already.'

‘ ¹ Benivolos auditores facere quattuor modis possumus, ab nostra, ab adversariorum
nostrorum, ab auditorum persona, ab rebus ipsis: Herenn. l. c.

· ¹ Quintil. iv. ii. 25, ib. v. ii.

'sw- ⁸ Cicero is here arguing the general question that homicide is sometimes justifiable.
’ z 'stis is iuridicialis constitutio absoluta. In such a case we must ask iurene sitsactum.
ᾖς’ 'To deddc this it is necessary to ask of what ius consists. Constat igitur ex his
-= - funibus: natura, Iege, consuetudine iudicato, aequo et bono, pacto: Herenn. ii. 19.
