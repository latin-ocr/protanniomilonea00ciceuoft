xxxviii PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

ἐξ 1—15, and it is hardly credible that Gulielmius would not have referre ¹

to it for any of these speeches. ,

If W then may be set aside, not merely because its tradition is

defective, but also because its loss is supplied by T, we are left witlr

, ΗΤΕ as the three MSS. of cardinal importance for the constitution o v.

the text ¹. I omit for the moment the fragments of P. What is 1113?ss

relative degree of credence to be attached to thern? Modern critics}

T. [Tegei-n· decide unanimously, and with reason, against T. I would refer to}-
seensis.] a valuable paper by Nohl in Hermes xxi. 195, and the preface to hisi:
edition of 1888. He shows that it manifests an inclination to the vulgar-⁴4}

family, and styles it the parens deteriorum. This phrase must not, however,

be taken too lsterally, since H and E also furnish material for the}
formation of the inferior text. Ι quote the following as a sample 2—— ἶ

§ 5. equidem: el quidem Ηδ. § 7. disputant: disputant. obt’ct'mt HJ

obiciunt σ. § 2. et iustissimi: illustrissimi Εδ (illustrissimique T). ξ 64?Z
malleolorum: malleorum Εδ. ''

The mediaeval copyist was fatally attracted by an error whereverssj

found3 the result being that the unemended dett. form a florilegium of*E
corruptions. That T, however, was the basis of the vulgar text will be,

apparent from the critical notes. I give here three instances: ξ 29. qui}

animo fideli z'n dominum et praesenti suerunt, T inserts erant before εἰς’-ξ

hence the corruption found in all the dett. ξ 89. oppressisset, om Tu}

ξ 102. Ο me infelicem, om. me, in each case being followed by all the dell-2

E· [Erfur- The result of this analysis is to leave us with H and E, between which-*ff
tensis.] the battle sor supremacy has to be fought out. The difficulties which}-
exist chiefly arise from the fact that, although the good readings for which ¹,

E has been preferred to T are, with a few doubtful exceptions, also found}

in H, the latter MS. has a number of variants peculiar to itself, ‘some oses
which are obviously right, while others are so striking that, if not correct, ε·
they must be due to wilful alteration. Gulielmius, who used the three}
MSS. HWE, preferred H, an opinion afterwards held by Garatoni and}
Madvig, who based their judgment upon the scanty collation then in
existence. Baiter, on the other hand, decided in favour of E, and is<
followed by recent editors, who vie with each other in their worship of
this MS. Thus C. F. W. Miiller follows it even in minute points of
spelling, e. g.§ 16 he prints illata, and a few lines lower inlata with its
Nohl, in his new edition of Richter—Eberhard, writing after the appearanc¹
of my Anecdoton, though he adopts several readings from H, andss
notably the most important of all, sc. ξ 46. om. cuius . . . Romae, declares·
