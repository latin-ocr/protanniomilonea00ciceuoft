xlviii PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

Apart from ordinary corruptions and silly additions, the speech has
specially suffered from the embodiment of scholia. These were taken
into the text from the margin, where they were originally placed. Such
scholia are found in the margin of P, e. g. ξ 73. aedem llfilmpharung the
annotator adds, ubi publici census continebantur. Such additions were in
some cases founded upon information supplied by Asconius. The case
in §46 has been already referred to. Other examples are ξ 27. quod erat
dictator Lanuvii Milo (Ascon. 32 Lanuvium, ex quo erat municipio, et ibi ,
tum dictator), and § 90. Sex. Clodio duce (Ascon. 34 populus duce Sex.
Clodio corpus P. Clodi in curiam intulit). In the first case the incorrect ‚
indicative, and in the second the confusion in the MSS„ testify to the
intrusion. Other more or less learned scholia have been pointed out by
Bake, e. g. § 35. reus enim Milonis lege Plotia suit Clodius, quoad vz'xc't,
a very dark saying, and § 59. de servis nulla lege quaestio est in dominum
nisi incesti [so H, de incestu TE] ut suit in Clodium, where the irregular
construction incesti betrays the annotator. Another case is § 89. quae est
inventa apud eum cum reliquis legibus Clodianis. The author of the latter
may well have been the 'gifted person, who in ξ 47. iacent suis testibus
added z'z', qui Clodium negant eo die Romam, nisi de Cyro audisset, fuz'sse
rediturum, a remark plainly against the sense, and only to be harmonized
with the context by emendation. The knowledge possessed by mediaeval
annotators may be estimated from the argument to this speech found in
H and E, where we arc told that he went into exile at Tomi in Scythia;
a confusion of his fate with that of Ovid ¹.

Lastly‚ it would be contrary to reason to suppose that the process
of corruption—whether mechanical, arising from the development of
a blunder, due originally to a slip of the pen, or semi-intelligent, owing
to the addition of variants from other MSS. by the corrector—such as is
revealed to us in the gradual formation of the inferior text, was not
equally operative in the preceding silent centuries. The best MS. has
its limitations, and it is well to recognise the insufficiency of our guides.

In this connexion I quote in full some very suggestive remarks of that
excellent scholar K. Lehmann, taken from an article to which Ι have
already referred ². ‘ What is the conclusion? I cherish the conviction
that in the ixth or Xth century there was in existence a current recension
of certain works of Cicero, into which readings were engrafted from
a good MS. by an intelligent and judicious critic, and that the result of
this process lies before usin the case of the speeches pro Milone, de Imp.
Cn. Pompei, &c.‚ in HETS [i. e. ς], and the other MSS. The conclusion
