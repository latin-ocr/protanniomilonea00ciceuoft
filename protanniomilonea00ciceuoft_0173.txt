2. Aaou manau: one of these
brothers had been spoken ofin Β. o. 58 as
a probable accuser of Q. Cicero upon his
zetum from Asia [Att. iii. 17. 1]. In

' 43 B. c. Cicero speaks of himself as closely

v:connectedby

pefi’iendship cum Appio
Clafflo C. F, so that he does not appear
to have resented their action on this occa-
sion [Fam. xi. υ. ι]. Manutius ac-
counts for the fact that neither of them
bore their father’s praenomen by suppos-
ffcfflptpiss, {²333 2? ‘Eiigab ..³331ss

sume.

3. Mat: the tense implies that C.
Claudius was dead. He was governor of
Asia· ιιι 55-54 B. c.‚ and on his return was
condemned for extortion. The enquiry
quo ea pecunia pervenisset was still going

· on in 51 B..,c when the younger Appius

Α Clgdius,

made some unfilial revelations concerning
his ather’s conduct [F.am viii. 8. 2].
C. Claudius had been οιι bad terms with
cicero [Ascon. in Scaur. 2 5].

5. 'epol ot Leo: the first of these
became the third accuser of Milo de vi,
inst. 42, while the second was a subscrzplor
in the case de ambitu, ib. 54.

1.. Serennia· Balbus: probably the
L. Herennius who was one of the ac-
cusenof Caelius [Cael. 25]. An enemy

of Caelius was a natural ally of the
claudian house.

Ins-01: he had lent gladiators to

and also paid rioters to attack
the house of M. Lepidus [Sehol. Bob. on

<25 † Caepionem conquestus est de hac caede P. Clodi : falsum esse

Q. l'ompei: as implicated in the burn-
ing of the curia.

8. Μ. Marcellus: for his oratorical
powers cf. Brut. 250. Dio, xl. 57, says
that he was elected consul διὰ τῶν λόγων
δύναμιν.

9. Η. caudium an elegant speaker
but deficient in fire. A fine appreciation
of his oratorical style is given Brut.
274 sqq·

faustus: this is the only occasion
upon which any relations of Milo's aristo-
cratic wife are mentioned as appearing
on his behals. At the trial os Scaurus in
54 B.C. Faustus made a great impression
upon the jurors humiliter et cum lacrimis
locutus [Ascon. in Scaur. ²9]-

tero die.

13. post diem tricem: i..e about Feb.
18. The sequence of events is not strictly
observed here, since Asconius has pre·
viously been speaking of what happened
in the intercalary mouth.

14. Π. †caepionem: Iretain the MSS.
reading, since it is difficult to see how
M. Ciceronem (ManutiusL M. Caelium
(Halm), orM Catonem (KS in Addendis)
could have been thus corrupted. The
simplest alteration would be to read
Q. Caepionem in which case M. Brutus
would be meant. He 1s not unsrequently
called Q. Caepio Brutus, e. g. Phil. x. 26.
As he afterwards wrote a defence of
