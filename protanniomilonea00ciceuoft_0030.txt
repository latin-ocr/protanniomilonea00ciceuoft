was thrown definitely against Milo, whose election would have, been
a serious impediment to the execution of his carefully-thought-out plan.
To Caesar, then preparing for his mighty struggle with Vercingetorix,
the candidature of Milo must have been still less agreeable. Milo was
not himself a man to initiate a policy, but he was an invaluable instru-
ment in carrying out the ideas of others. With Cato, Bibulus, and
Domitius Ahenobarbus at his back to inspire him, the ‘fighting consuls·
would at once have proceeded to attack the ‘citade11’ of Caesar, by·
impugning the legality of his acts during his consulship.
From the point of view of public interest the election of Milo would
have been a deplorable one. He had given no indication of any highet‘
qualities than those suitable to a captain of bandilii. His savage instincta,
foolhardy courage, and narrow vision made him incapable of realizing3
the responsibilities of office. His talent for running into debt struck
his friends as amazing‘ss. If he had been sent to a province his
rapacity must have known no bounds. Verres was content to makes
‘three fortunes³’ in Sicily, but Milo had squandered three inheritances
already⁴, and the exactions of such a spendthrift must have been
colossal, if he wished to replenish his empty coffers.
Cicero was Milo' s most enthusiastic backer. He never forgot that
although Pompey sanctioned his recall, and the optimates made it a party-
question, still it was to Milo that he owed everything. One of the most
charming traits in his character is the warmth of his gratitude to those
who worked in his behalf, not only to Milo, but also to the cross·grained2
and chilling⁵ Sestius. Also, in the matter of his friends, he was,> an
ineurable optimist. He did not see that there was no room sor such.
a person as Milo in a civilized community. The year before he incurred
the ridicule of Caesar by endeavouring to bring about a reconciliation*
between him and Milo ⁶, while he was seriously disappointed, when he
found that Pompey definitely set his face against his former associate:
He endeavoured to secure for Milo young Curio, then coming back from⁴
Asia, whose peculiar genius sor intrigue would have made him an
admirable electioneering agent. He says, W‘e want a leader, an
adviser, some one to rule and guide the infiuences of which I spoke,
and, if we had to choose one person out of all mankind, 1 know οἱ
no one comparable to yourself⁷.' Curio, however, the ‘creature .
