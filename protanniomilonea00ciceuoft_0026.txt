but was manifestly inapplicable to ordinary criminals. The Roman laW,
however, drew no distinction between the two classes. The selon or
murderer could ‘ take sanctuary ¹ ' in exile, and there begin his operations
anew. Sometimes it was not necessary for him to go far. Such
a monster as Oppianicus of Larinum, with the blood of unnumbered
victims upon his hands, is able not only to roam about Italy, but even has
a lodging just outside Rome2. The treatment of vulgar crime by the
Romans ls a matter of some obscurity, since our record of such cases is
scanty. That however such offences could only >be proceeded against
before an ordinary quaestio is clear ³. A magistrate could only employ
his coercitio within narrow and recognized limits4 3 otherwise, as in the
case of Damio, he would be checked by the intervention of a tribune.

The trz'umvz'r capz'lalzir, who was at the head of the weak police, could μ

indeed arrest a criminal for inquiry ⁶, but it is not conceivable that he
would have been able to violate the person of a citizen by the infliction
of appropriate penalties. The conclusion is startling, since it follows

that crime of every description, such as is found in all large centres of ·
civilization and must have been rampant at Rome, was, if committed by ,

a citizen, protected frorn the sword of justice. Roman legislators had

never contemplated the task of governing a large criminal population. .

The mob, however, such as now existed, pauperized by public doles,
brutalized by the horrors of the arena, and degraded by the continued
infiltration of slave· blood, possessing nothing but a dagger to use and
a vote to sell, was manifestly unfit for such extraordinary privileges.
Further, while the penalty awarded to crime was thus inadequate, it does
not appear to have been rigorously inflicted. A generation, which
allowed the owner to torture or put to death his slaves, as the humour

seized him, was strangely sentimental when the caput of a Roman was ..
concerned. In no other way can we explain the language of the orators‚ ⁴
who speak of the trivial penalty of exile as something too cruel for ε,
merciful men to inflict upon a fellow- creature. ⁶ Humanitarianism ran ,ς’
within a narrow channel at Rome, but it ran deep. The inviolability of v

the citizen had indeed become a mischievous anachronism, and it must
have been a benefit to the world, when under the Empire the criminals}
was made to suffer 1n life and limb for his crimes.

The story of Roman anarchy rs inseparably connected with the name
of Clodius. It rs not here to the point to inquire what degree of credence
