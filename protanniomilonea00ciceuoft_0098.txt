dimissus, domum venit; calceos et vestimenta mutavit3 paulisper,
dum se uxor, ut fit, comparat, commoratus est, dein profectus

erat, redire potuisset.

defend himself by saying, that he really
meant the 18th ; while in this passage, if
the words quae illo ipso die habita est are
read, he definitely commits himself to
a salse statement. We must therefore
suppose (i) that he did this, or had a lapse
of memory, or, (ii) that the words are a
scholium coming from some one who
was misled by the ambiguity in § 45.
The latter appears more probable, since
a false statement of this kind would have
been easily exposed. Illo ipso die can
only mean ‘that same day': cf. Fam.
v. 2. 8.

1. obire: the word is used os a place,
e. g. Verr. v. 29 obire provinciam, also of
time, e. g. diem edicti Phil. iii. 20, or of
keeping an engagement: e.g. cenas . . .
obire Att. viii. 12. 3. For the combina-
tion in the present passage, Colson quotes
Lael. 7 diem et munus obire.

2. senatus est dimissus: according to
Metellus Scipio ‘post horam quartam, ²
i..e about 10 a. m, As con 36. Cicero
throughout the story tries to post· -date
Milo’ s movements; the other side doubt-
less aute- dated them.

3. calceos. . . mutavit: 1. e. put on
ordinary calcei in place of those peculiar
to senators ι calceos mutare also means to
‘ become a senator,’ e. g. Phil. xiii. 28,
the process being in this case reversed.
Quintil. comments upon the ‘artful affec-
tation of simplicity ' which characterises
this passage. Cicero uses ordinary and
conversational words—‘ quae si aliter dicta
essent, strepitu ipso iudicem ad custo-
diendum patronum excitassent' (iv. 2. 57).

5. 16. temporis: this does not=eo tem-
pore, but at that bour os the day, i. e. so
late: cf. ξ 54 where it=vesper12 In Cat.

noctis venis, i. e. so late at night? So also
id aetatzs Verr. ii. 37: maior natu, and
Clu. ¹41 cum z’d aetatis filio=‘ of such
tendet years? See Landgraf on Rosc. Am.

8. quod numquam tere. Fulvia was
a very devoted wife to her successive
husbands. For her grief ‘at the death
of Clodius see Ascon. 3341. Probably
little credence should be 4given to the
description of Clodius’ ordinary retinue
in ξ 55 semper secum scorta, &c. Fulvia
at any rate does not seem to have been
conscious of her wrongS.

10. magno et impedito : Cicero cannot
deny the size of Milo's retinue, so he
ingeniously suggests that he was hand1
capped by it. The account of its com—

is explained by ancillarum and delicato by
puerorum— cf. § 68 aegras . . . labantes . . .
sanares . . . confirmares. For delicato Reid
quotes Mart. x. 62. 3 delicatae choms
mensae. Cicero is careful to explain that
these attendants belonged to Fausta. An
enemy would doubtless have described
them in the language employed by Cicero
of Clodius’ train, or that of Antony, Phil.
