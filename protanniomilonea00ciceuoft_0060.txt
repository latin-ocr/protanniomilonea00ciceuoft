l PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

himself an Atticist. He says that they are content to avoid faults‚ but
that something more than this is necessary for excellence. Sobriety and
chastity of style are insufficient if unaccompanied by breadth‚ elevation‚
and grandeur. A good style needs power, sinews, and the breath of life.
His critics unduly narrow the meaning of ‘ Attic ⁹ and arbitrarily choose'·
Lysias as their model, forgetting that there is a greater Attic writer in
the person of Demosthenes. The characteristic of the latter is the
variety of his moods ; he can be passionate, as well as restrained. Lysias
cannot raise his voice, but Demosthenes can at need lower his. Cicero
therefore definitely adopts Demosthenes as his pattern‚ and in the sense
that they approximate in style to his, the speeches os this period may be
classed as Attic, the Legarztzna being the best specimen of this third
manner. In other words, his last style is a compromise in favour of the
Attic, while his middle one had been in favour of the Asiatic school.
The theories of Cicero upon the subject are set forth in the tract de optimo
genere Oratorzcm—ascribed to the year in which the llffilont‘ana was
composed—which was intended to serve as an introduction to a translation
now lost of the de Corona, together with the rival speech of Aeschines ¹.

As a piece of composition this oration is interesting from the perfectiori
of its technique. All the rules laid down in the text-books upon rhetoric
are strictly observed. This technical perfectiori made it a savourite
source of quotations for Quintilian and later writers z and gives the
modern student an admirable opportunity of studying the laws of forensic
composition, even if its very faultlessness of construction occasionally
makes him when reading the speech sigh for a little irregularity.

The contemporary handbooks embracing the theory of oratorical
composition are the ad C. Herennium de arte rhetorica, now ascribed to
Cornificius, and the re'cbauffe' of this, written by Cicero, de Inventione
rhetorica, in which he occasionally modifies the canons laid down in the
older treatise.

I append the following analysis of the speech² :—

(i) Exordium. “

The objects to be aimed at in this are three in number, ‘ ut attentos, ut
dociles, ut benivolos auditores habere possimus ³.' In order to make the
hearer attentus, it is necessary to dwell upon the gravity of the subject, to
make him dociles, one must state the summa causae, to make him benivolus,
one should appeal to persona] considerations.

The exordium in this speech is one of those termed περιστατικά, i. e.
