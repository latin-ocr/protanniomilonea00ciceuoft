agrees with the past life of Clodius, but not with that of Milo.

2. SIGNA, ARGUMENTA ξ 44.

A szgrnum is evidence to show idonea perficiendi facultas ¹. Of this
there are six main varieties: locus, tempus, spatium, occasio, spes
perficiendi, spes celandi. An argumentum is evidence drawn from the
behaviour of a person, before, during, or after the act ².

An argumentum against Clodius is that three days before he said to
Favonius that Milo had only three days to live. This leads one to

consider 2-

[a] Tempus ἕξ 45, 51-

(i) The day ³. Milo was forced to leave Rome on the 18th, Clodius
was required at Rome on that day for a meeting. Clodius could easily
know that Milo would be travelling on the 18th, Milo could not know
this of Clodius, since, according to the evidence of the latter’s friends, he
had not intended to travel at all, but to spend the night of the 18th in his
villa. This evidence clears Milo, since he could have had no knowledge.
It does not, however, clear Clodius, since the statement was merely
a blind. He was waiting for Milo, and came out to attack him.

(ii) The bour. Why should Clodius start on a journey Just before
nightfall? No explanation can be given, unless that he wished to waylay
Milo. If Milo, however, had intended to waylay Clodius, his obvious
course was to wait till the latter was near Rome, and to slay him under
the cover of night. The only other alternative was to kill him before he
reached his villa at all, when on his way from Aricia.

The arguments thus far used are now restated in a series of
antitheses under the form offrequentatzbfi The probabile ex causa and
ex vz‘la3 the, day and the hour of the occurrence all divert suspicion from
Milo. and cast it on Clodius, ᾗ 52.

[b] Locus s 53, 54·

On this the advocate rightly lays the greatest stress. It was Just before
the estate of Clodius, where he had a thousand men employed, and on
rising ground that the fray took place. If the encounter were represented
in a picture, a glance would tell us who was the aggressor.
