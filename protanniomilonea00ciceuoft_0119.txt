PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

timentes in suspicionem caderent, tota denique rea citaretur

Etruria.

Atque illo die certe Aricia rediens devertit Clodius ad se in 51 f,
Albanum. Quod ut sciret Milo, illum Ariciae fuisse, suspicari ¹
tamen debuit eum, etiam si Romam illo die reverti vellet, ad
villam suam, quae viam tangeret, deversurum. Cur nec ante
occurrit, ne ille in villa¹resideret, nec eo in loco subsedit, quo ille

cf. Tac. Anu. ii. 30, iv. 11, &c. In either
case the locus is personffied, just as the
solitude is ‘speechlessss and the night
‘blind‚' cf. ξς 20, 85. We leam from
Ascon. ad loc. and Att. vii. 9. 1 that
highwaymen infested this part of the Via
Appia. It is, however, hardly likely that
they would have ventured to molest the
armed retinue of Clodius.

,tuam ‘secondly‚' followed by deinde,
‘thirdly.’ Nohl compares Sest. 14¹- The
usual sequence is primum . . . deinde . . .
tum, e. g. N. D. ii. 3.

1. deinde: ibi [E] and ubi [T] are
various forms of an addition in their
archetype. Ibi ought to mean ‘there‚'
i. e. in the latronum occultator . . . locus,
which wo'uld unduly narrow the meaning.
The victims of Clodius were scattered
over all Etruria.. Other interpretations
are (i) that ibi stands for si ibi occisus
esset [Halm], which hardly seems possible,

I,would submit that the MSS. evidence
is here against ibi. There is a precisely
similar interpolation, Imp. Pomp. 33, ex
Miseno autem eius ipsius liberos, qui curn
praedonibus antea ibi bellum gesserat,
where I omit ibi with H [Anecd. p. lx'l.
Antonius, who is referred to, fought the
pirates in Cilician writers, not off Misenum.

Clodius to have been at Aricia, he ought
to have guessed that he would stop at his
villa, even if he meant to return to Rome
that day. If so. his proper course was
either (i) to stop him from getting to his
villa, or (ii) to wait for him outside of
Rome, after he had left his villa. He
did neither, but met him on his own
ground. The conclusion is that he did
not waylay him at all.'

ad se in Albanum: cf. Att. iv. 9. 1
venit ad me in Cumanum a se, Rep. iii.
40 cum venerat ad se in Sabinos, Orat. 1 10
cum ad te in Tusculanum venissem, de
Orat. ii 13 ad me in Tusculanum, Fat.
frag. 5 cum esset apud se ad Lavernium
Scipio. Q. F. ii. 5 (6). 3 in hortos adPom-
peium lectica latus sum. As the addition
ad se is so idiomatic, and so likely to have
been obelised by a corrector, it is sur-
prising that no editor since Garatoni has
defended this reading.

6. quod ut . . . misse: see § 15n'.

7. tamen: the word seems out of place :
logically it should go with deversurum,
i. e. ‘in spite of his return, still he would
halt‚‘ but grammatically it goes with sus-
