orthography which Cicero used! There appear to me to be difficulties
in the way of either system.

To take first that of C. F. W. Miiller. He generally follows E
(xiisxiii cent), but sometimes adopts a spelling from T (xi cent.), and
where P (prob. vsvi. cent.) is exstant, generally follows it. The result is
a curious mixture. Thus in ξ 35 he gives inprobos, finding this spelling
attributed to P in Baiter's notes; but elsewhere improbus. As a matter
of fact P has improb. here also, the statement of Baiter being due to an
erroneous inference. He prints inpune always, but in ξ 39 impunitate,
where, however, HT give z'npun. also. In ξ 45 he has adproperaret with
E, but in ᾗ 48 appropinquare, again following E. The other spelling
adprop. is, however, here found in H. Generally he omits s after exin
words like exspecto, but § 49 has exspectandum. This apparently is not
a printer’s error, but due to the fact that E, which generally omits s, here
retains it (H gives expect.) ¹. In ξ 16 he gives illata with E, but a few
lines further has inlata, also with E (H has inlata in both places). This
variety is very bewildering to a reader. While Ι do not dispute that
Cicero may have varied his practice, Ι would urge that the evidence of
our MSS. is of little value in regard to such minutiae. Thus in § 92 the
palimpsest gives inploro immediately after implorat. Is not this obviously
due to accident, rather than to a genuine tradition? If, however, this
applies to a really ancient MS. such as P, a fortiori it is true of a late
MS. such as E. Anyone who has handled tenth· or eleventh-century
MSS. is aware that in them such spellings as e. g. inlata, inploro, and the
like, are systematically altered to ill. and impl. by the second hand, the
alteration being generally reproduced in later MSS. of the same stock.
Such varieties then as those in E are, in all probability, due to the
vagaries of a corrector, and do not deserve serious attention.

The second system, that of Dr. Reid, is one to which 1 arn much
attracted. Ι have, however, not seen my way to adopt it on this occasion.
In the first place, this edition is largely concerned with textual questions,
and I do not like‘ to so far desert the MSS. as to print e. g. novom,
avonculus, propincus, and the like. I also suspect that more extensive 4
changes will be necessary if we endeavour to arrive at the orthography ¹
which Cicero actually used. To take a simple case. We are expressly
told by Quintil. (i. 7. 20) that Cicero wrote caussa, cassus, divz'mzb, &c.‚
‘ as was shown by writings in his hand.' Dr. Reid formerly pn‘nted
caussa, but in his edition of this speech has returned to causa. I certainly
do not think that public opinion is yet ripe for cassus and divis-uo, yet
the evidence for these forms is unimpeachable ². Also, in some cases it is
