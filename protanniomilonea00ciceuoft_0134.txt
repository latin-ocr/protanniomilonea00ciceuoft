60 M. TULLI CICERONIS

esset conquietura‚ ne ipse haud dubitans cessisset patria, is qui

ita natus est et ita consuevit3 te, Magne, tamen ante testaretur,

26 quod nunc etiam facit. Vides, quam sit varia vitae commuta-

s' 69 bilisque ratio, quam vaga volubilisque Fortuna, quantae infi-

delitates in amicitiis, quarn ad tempus aptae simulatione8,5 ¹

quantae in periculis fugae [proximorum], quantae timiditates.
Erit, erit illud profecto tempus et illucescet ille aliquando dies,
cum tu †salutaribus‚ ut spero, rebus tuis, sed sortasse motu

1. ipse, scripsi: iste codd.; ille Kays.; is Garat.
Lambin.: an testaretur E; antestaretur T.

4. Fortuna, scripsi: fortuna vulg.

5. vamicitiis HE z amicis Τδ.

2. ante testaretur Hs,

3. vides HE: vide Τδ.
6. ante

proximorum commate distinguit Eberhard ε mihi verbum spurium videtur. 7. et

illud T. ille aliquando HE : aliquando ille Τδ.

8. †salutaribus HEB: salu-

britatibus T: salvis Anton. Augustinus ; sort. integris v. p. xliii. motu Ta: metu HE.

1. ipse: i.e. sua sponte. The MSS.
iste is kept by modern editors, as expressing
sympathy‚ cf. Clu. 201 ne iste miser saepe
et multum queretur. This hardly suits
the defiant attitude of Milo. Is does not
sound well, while ille is not used of Milo,
ᾗ 56 n. For the confusion of iste and
ipse, which Ι conjecture, cf. Reid on Ac.
i. 2, and Landgraf, krit. Anh. on Rosc.
Am. 18. .

2. magne: the title is here used to
remind Pompey that as he is great, he
should also be generous. He is constantly
termed splagnus in the Letters‚ and was
probably always styled so by his intimates,
just as e. g. the friends ofClod1us addressed
him as Pulcher: cf. Dom. 22. Lucan
constantly employs it. Curiously enough
it has not passed into currency as a name
for Pompey in modern writers.

ante testaretur ε ‘ would call you
to witness‚’ sc. to his merits. The impf.
is more vivid than the plupf. would have
been. The variant antestaretur can only
mean, ‘ would summon you as a witness‚'
[i. e. by plucking your ear,' Hor. Sat. i. 9.
76], ‘ to his case against his country)
No instance of the word is quoted except
in this technieal sense, and it seems bold
to say with Poynton, that ‘ if we had more
legal Latin, we should find a parallel ¹ to
the sense assigned to it here. That T mis—
represents the archetype of TE is shown
by the reading of E. The corruption is
a familiar one, -te being omitted by lipo-
graphy. I am glad to see that Dr. Reid
has adopted this certain reading.

3. commutabilis: only here in the
speeches. According to Rebling (rom.
Umgangspr. p. 24), only a limited number

of these adjectives in -bilis found their
way into the sermo urbanus.

4. volubilis rortuna: for the ima-
gery cf. ad Herenn. ii. 36
saxocllule2 linstare in globoso praedicant

vo u 11:

id quo saxum impulerit fors, eo cadere

Fortunam autumant.

Forgtuna appears to be personified: cf.
§s 3, 87 n·

6. fugae: RE place a comma before
this, and take prox. with the following
clause, in order to preserve the symmetry
[‘ durch die Interpunktion davor wird die
symmetrische Lange der Glieder gewahrtl]
The anaphora, however, of quantae . . .
quam, &c. shows that quantae should
come first in the clause. 1 prefer to
bracket the word. Fugae does not require
a genitive of its own, since amicorum can
readily be supplied from amicitiis. For
similar reflections ef. Fam. ii. 7. 2.

7. erit: Cicero's ‘ political augury’
was a weak point with him, and it is
possible that, as has been suggested, he
may have inserted this passage aster
Pharsalus: cs. Fam. vi. 6. 4 dicerem quae
ante futura dixissem, ni vererer ne ex
eventis fingere viderer. Later writers
took his pretensions seriously, e. g. Nepos,
Att. 16. 4 non enim Cicero ea solum, quae
vivo se acciderunt, futura praedixit, sed
etiam quae nunc usu veniunt, cecinit ut
vates.

8. †ealutaribue: this word cannot be
right, since salutaris: ‘health·giving,’
while salubribus is no better. The only
correction which has any primafacie
plausibility is salvis rebus [omitting rebus
before tuis]: for which cf. Fam. iv. 1. 1
