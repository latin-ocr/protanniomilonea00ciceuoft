a conjecture afterwards made by Gruter, and in ξ 64, over an erasure,{
gives framearum, afterwards read by Lambinus. Both readings are due 3
to a fifteenth- -century hand. -

(iii) Auct. Rawl. G. 137, termed 8 by the collators. I call it ω. This}
is a very late MS. ,probably of the sixteenth century. Though vulgar 111¹!
basis, it contains several interesting readings, doubtless due to conjectura}
e. g. ξ 17. interfectus est, so Madvig, §26. Marco Favonio, so Krause.
§43 om. audaciae, so Ferrarius and Garatoni. § 92. in infimi, so rece..1''

The exclusion of ς from the list of authoritative MSS. much simplifies 2
the problem, since we are now left with the sour German MSS„ and the ξ

fragments of P, the relationship of which Ι proceed to discuss. To begin}

Our information concerning this comes chiefly from F. Fabricius, who}
in 1569 published an edition of the pro Milone and the dc Provincaze}
Consularz'bus. The book is a rare one. The copy, which I myself}
consulted in the library at Heidelberg, once belonged to Graeviusg
Fabricius says that he had himself previously collated the MS. in
Saxon), and sent some readings to Lambinus, for the use of that scholari}
in his second edition. Owing, however, to the delay' 111 the publication of 3
this, he added some notable readings to the above- mentioned edition,
which was then being printed at Diisseldorf. His work is dedicated to i
the ownerof the MS. D. Paulus Bruin, his readings being specimens‚l
unde tui beneficii magnitudo, tamquam ex ungue leo, cognosceretur. Bruin ,ῗ
was at this time a pastor at Werden, near Dusseldorf, and had brought
the MS. with him from Saxony. Lambinus was highly impressed by3
these readings, and in the notes to his posthumous· edition frequently.{
quotes this Saxonz‘cus perantiquus, and says that all the emendations}
peculial· to this edition are taken from it. His opinion of its merits was ”
not unnatural, since this was the first occasion upon which a member of<
the meliores became accessible to scholars ¹. Unfortunately‚ however, we
cannot be sure to what variants he refers, unless he expressly mentions-
the MS. in his notes, on account of the reckless manner in which such‘·
symbols as v. c. [vetus codex], or L. [Lambinus] are used by the sciolus,-
who, aster the death of this great scholar, mangled his work under the'
pretence of editing it. ,

The MS. was also used by Gulielmius, who does not, however, quote}

    
   
   
  

¹ In my Anecdoton Ι thought that Lambinus had obtained readings taken directly
from H. Ι now think it more probable that these came from some such MS. asv
h or 5, into which they had entered in the manner explained above. ·
