80 M. TULLI CICERONIS

satellitibus curiam incenderit? Quo quid miserius, quid acer-
bius, quid luctuosius vidimus? templum sanctitatis, amplitudinis,
mentis, consili publici, caput urbis, aram sociorum, portum
omnium gentium, sedem ab universo populo concessam uni
ordini, inflammari, exscindi, funestari, neque id fieri a multi-
. tudine imperita, quamquam esset miserum id ipsum, sed ab uno!
Qui cum tantum ausus sit ustor pro mortuo, quid signifer pro
vivo non esset ausurus? In curiam potissimum abiecit, ut eam

1. satellitibus: Sex. Clodio duce add. codd.; Sex. Clodio del. Madvig, ego duce.
2. vidimus3 templum: vidimus, templum C. F. W. Miiller; Vidimus templum
Meyer. 3. urbis: orbis H. 5. exscindi, funestari: excindi. funestari.
excindi H. 6. ab: om. H. 7. quid: quod E. 8. ausurus H: ausus rell.

. . . illatum fuit. In H the alien clement
is unmistakeable: it is recognizable in E,
while T, more suo, digests the addition.
That Sex. Clodio must be excluded was
seen by Madvig, who says, ‘it is not
only superfluous, but spoils the sense, the
contrast being between the chieftain and
one of his followers‚ so that the proper
name cannot be added to ‘the general
term’ [Op. Ac. i. 154]. He thought the
words a gloss to duce. If duce however
remains, apart from the evidence afforded
by the confusion in the MSS„ the sense is
strange. Clodius is said to have burnt
the Curia, uno ex suis satell. duce. If we
ask, whom the satelles led, the answer
can only be, ‘ the ghost of Clodius.' The
phrase is only applicable if he was dux
to a crowd: cf. ᾗ 95 multitudinem, quae
P. Clodio duce . . . imminebat. With the
reading which I propose the antitheses are
ille >< unus ex. s. sat„ vivus >< mortuo, mali
nihil fecisset >< curiam incenderit. The
emendation is accepted by Poynton. Col-
son erroneously terms it the reading of H.

2. sanctitatis: ‘ morality ' : ‘sanctus
as an epithet is especially used of states-
men, who discharge the dictates of
morality towards the state and society so
far as it comes into contact with the state '
[Seyffem Lael. p. 28o].

amplitudinis: the senate being am-
plissimus ordo, cf. ξ 4n.

3. consili. publici: cf. Cato M. 19
summum consilium of the senate: so Leg.
Agr. ii. 88 si. . . publicum ex illa urbe
consilium sustulissent, where it signifies
the local senate of Capua. 1 cannot
agree with Dr. Reid, who says that cons.
publ. does not mean here ‘the senate‚’ bnt
is used as sest. 43 sanguis nullo publico
consilio profusus.

caput urbis : for the variant orbis see

§ 72 n. Possibly, however, orbis (terrae)
should be read, cf. Fam. iii. 8. 4 in publico
orbis terrae consilio, id est, in senatu,
Phil. vii. 19 summo consilio orbis terrae.

aram . . . portum: cf. Verr. v. 126
hie portus, haec arx, haec ara sociorum,
Caecin. 100 exsilium . . . est perfugium
portusque supplici . . . confugiunt quasi
ad aram, in exsilium.

4. uni: Rau objects to this that it
would be invidious to speak of the Curia
as the peculias possession of one privileged
order. Cicero, however, uses the word
without attaching special meaning to it,
as yielding his favourite antithesis of unus
and universus, e. g. Sest. 27, 33, 122, 128,
&c- Cf. 5 34 n.

5. inflammari: cf. the line of Ennius
haec omnia vidi inflammari Sest. 121.
exscindi: I somewhat doubt the genuine·
ness of this word: the corruption in H
seems to point to its having originally
been a supra-lineal addition.

fune-tari: sc. by the corpse of
Clodius: cf. Rab. Perd. 11 funestari
contionem contagione carnificis veto.

6. ab uno: Cicero here attributes the
deed to Sextus alone, not as Asconius, to

*the multitude led by him. This is a

strong argument against the words Sex.
Clodio duce supr.

7. ustor: a slave belonging to the
libitinarius, ef. sordidus ustor, Lucan, viii.
738, semirasus u., Catull. lix. 5 [Wirz].

signifer: cs. Att. ii. 1. 7 te signifero
ac principe, Plane. 74 causae nostrae
duces et quasi signiferi, Ascon. 33 antesig-
nanus servorum.

8. austu-us: the sut. partic. is used
as an antithesis to the past, ausus. ‘ He
had done so much in the past, what
would he not have been likely to do in
the future ’ζ’ ·
