78 M. TULLI CICERONIS

nos servis nostris addicerent3 nihil erat cuiusquam, quod quidem
ille adamasset, quod non hoc anno suum fore putaret. Ob-
stabat eius cogitationibus nemo praeter Milonem. Illum ipsum,

>qui poterat obstare, novo reditu in gratiam quasi devictum

arbitrabatur; Caesaris potentiam suam esse dicebat3 bonorum 5
33 animos in meo casu contempserat3 Milo unus urgebat. Hic

di immortales, ut supra dixi, mentem illi perdito ac furioso
dederunt, ut huic faceret insidias. Aliter perire pestis ‘illa
non potuit3 numquam illum res publica suo iure esset ulta.
Senatus, credo, praetorem eum circumscripsisset. Ne cum
solebat quidem id facere, in privato eodem hoc aliquid profecerat.

1. servis nostris: sc. libertinis‚ see
Aseon. ad loc„ and de Aere al. Milonis,
iv. 1. Colson, who thinks that Clodius
had an extensive programme, suggests on
ξ 89 that ‘ he is credited with a scheme
for manumitting slaves under some con·
ditioris without the consent of their
masters, and making himself their pa-
tronus ’ (cf. Fronde, Caesar, p. 303). The
passage which he quotes from Dio C.
xxxix. 23 to show that Clodius wished
the slaves from Cyprus to be called
Claudii does not prove anything‚ since
another proposal was to call them Porcii
after Cato l I hold that as praetor Clodius
would have little power, and that he had
few proposals to make. Cicero con-

‘ - tinually harps upon the same string.

2. adamasset: ‘took a fancy to' (Purser).
Krebs-Allg. explain the word as meaning,
‘conceive nn affection sor,’ rather than
‘ love deeply.’ Reid on Ac. ii. 9 says ‘ ad
has the same sense as πρό in προμανθάνειν,
sc. learn by degrees.’ With the exception
of adamare Fin. i. 69, only the perf. and
plupf. are used in classical Latin.

4. novo reditu: cf. ξ 21 n.

quasi ‹lev-ictum. : I retain doubt—
fully the reading of the German MSS.
Clodius looks on Pompey as ‘ conquered '
by a trick, sc. the reconciliation. The
metaphor agrees with the context, the
expressions being derived from struggling
with an antagonist, sc. obstabat . . . obstare
. . . potentiam . . . urgebat. As the ex-
pression is a bold one, quasi is used to
soften it according to the usual idiom.
The ehoiee seems to lie between this and

reading sibi devinctum with Lambinus,
i. e. under obligations to himself, cf.
Fam. i. 7. 3 virum tibi tua praestanti in
eum liberalitate devinctum ib. 9. 21 ut
ego eum mihi devinctum putarem. In the
ordinary reading there is this difficulty,
that, whether devinct. is translated ‘ bound
to’ or ‘bound down,' quasi is equally
unnecessary since the met. is a very well-
worn one, e. g. Sest. 15 hunc . . . Cn.
Pompeius omni cautione, foedere, ex-
secratione devinxerat; F at. 20 mentem
hominis voluntate libera spoliatam ne-
cessitate fati devinciunt. A large number
of instances are to be found in Merguet,
but in none is quasi used.

7. supra: sc. in 5 84,

10. circumscripsisset: specially used
of tribunes, when their veto was dis-
regarded‚ Momms. Staatsr. iii. 1226. 3.
Here it is used generally of action taken
against other magistrates by the senate,
e. g. censure, or suspension.

11. solebat: i. e. in the days when it
had more power than at present.

privato: Asconius refers this to the
time when Clodius was quaestor de·
signatus, i. e. in 62 Β. c., when he outraged
the rites of the Bona Dea, and thinks the
sen. cons. then passed, and the special

, quaestio decreed are here alluded to. As

a matter of fact however, though the
offence was committed in Dec. 62 (in the
previous year the festival was kept on
Dec. 4, Plut. Cic. 19), no notice was
taken of it until 61, when Clodius must
have become quaestor, an office which
he would enter on Dec. 5 (Staatsrecht, i.
