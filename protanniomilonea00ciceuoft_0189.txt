IN MILONIANAM. 115

Idem Τ. Munatius Plancus, ut saepe diximus, post audita et
obsignata testium verba dimissosque interim iudices vocata con-
§stione cohortatus erat populum, ut clusis tabernis postero die ad

‘'iudicium adesset nec pateretur elabi Milonem.

(ἦ 87.) Incidebantur iam domi leges, quae nos servis

nostris addicerent.

significasse iam puto nos fuisse inter leges P. Clodi, quas ferre
ispi-oposueraneam quoque, qua libertini, qui non plus quam in

(IIII) tribubus suffragium serebant, possent in rusticis quoque
trihubus, quae propriae ingenuorum sunt, ferre.

(ἧ 88.) Senatus, credo, praetorem eum circumscrip-

sisset. Ne cum solebat quidem id facere, in privato

- Significat id tempus quo P. Clodius, cum adhuc quaestor
designatus esset, deprensus est, cum intrasset eo, ubi sacrificium

pro Ι populo Romano fiebat. Quod factum notatum erat gravi 53
S. C., decretumque extra ordinem de ea re iudicium fieret.
