, this does not prove that the latter reading has not come to H
's an equally old, and possibly better, MS. The case must be judged
ε its merits.
’‘rhe existence of variants in the text of this speech, as in other works
acero, at an early date, is shown by the evidence of Gellius and
J “ oius. Gellius distinguishes between the lz'brz minus accurate
 Ϊ·’-ε’” and those embodying the revision of Tiro. He assigns to the
*mi the reading versabatur in ξ 53, and versabantur [so all our MSS.

⁴2k‘us] to the inferior copies.
*The quotations in the grammatical and rhetorical writers are very Quintilian.
eisive and contradictory. Most of them come from Quintilian, whose
’ζ ε ⁴ -ε suess in such matters is well known. Frequently he contradicts
m: lf. Thus in one place [xi. 3. 172] he quotes correctly O me in-
'mean § 102, and in another [vi. 1. 24] gives 0 te infelicem. In
2. 25 he gives occisum fateatur [§ 7], but in v. 1 1. 12 has occisum esse
χ’ ⁴r. In ix. 3. 28 he quotes occidi, occidi [§ 72]‚ but in v, 11. 12
νε t MSS. give occidi once. Sometimes he mistakes the meaning, e. g.
ες ⁸12 cum patriam periculo suo liberasset, where he omits suo [v. 11. 12],
’ἱῑϊε ,s perverting the sense. So § 94 Ο cogztatzbnes inanes meae, he quotes
J Ο cogit. in. meas, regardless of the nominative in the preceding clause.
⁸· curious fact is, that he is followed in his slipshod quotations by later
ἀπε, who do not seem to have troubled themselves to consult a MS.
ε instructive instance occurs in his quotation of § 41. Here for
ἵῃι he gives aliqua, a very inferior reading, omits quem impune,
orda necessary to the sense, and inserts cum before periculo. His errors
'⁷ faithfully reproduced by Isidorus and Cassiodorus. In ξ 9 he omits
bomae'rtem occiclmdum [v. 14. 18J, and is followed by Julius Victor
Diomedes· ‚ in § 30 he gives sz ul for saut, so Julius Victor.
In a certain number of cases the citations of Quintilian make for
for against the readings of our MSS. Two obvious ones are ξ 1, where
j omits veterem with TE, and ᾗ 85, where he gives testor with H
{obtestor TE] ¹. In both of these it may be assumed that he found the
’ᾗ ‘ g, which he quotes, in his copy: though of course the other
mding may also have been in circulation at the time. An important
