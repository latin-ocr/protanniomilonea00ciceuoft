currendum ad curiam putaretis, Att. iv.
¹1. 6 homines ad theatrum primo, deinde

rall uses curro of a single person, e.g.
Phi . ii. 50 ad Caesarem cucurristi: cf.
however Verr. ν. 92 curritur ad prae-
torium, where probably concurritur [sc.
nunu] should beread. The corruption is
ayery simple one: cf. p. xl. on ξ 39. Itis a

besides this, while concurro occurs 23
This is probably due to the
natural tendency of an orator to use
forcible words: he thus prefers to speak
of the ‘rush’ of a crowd than of an
individual running. Cf. Landgraf's sug-
gentive note on Rosc. Am. 23.

cum. mima ad cutem: 1 was
led to make this correction by a com·
parison of two other passages, where
the same annominatio is found, Sen. 7
cum ferro et facibus homines tota urbe
volitantes . . . consulis fasces fractos, and
Quir. 14 ad magistratuum domos cum
ferro ac facibus iretur, consulis fasces
f ntur. Cf. also Att. viii. 15. 1
¹ 11εέ tibi puto esse faciendum; et ignoras,
§ornithia cum fascibusne sit, quod cum

ι teies, facies ut sciamus. Cicero is de-

ad domum Scipt’onis et Hypsaei, διο. The
new detail which he gives is that the

fasces were taken to the temple of Castor,

this probably being the scene of a contio,
addressed by a demagogue from the steps.
1 afterwards found *that the correction is
an old one, being printed by Lambinus
without comment, and accepted by
Gulielmius. Abram [Paris 1631] ex·
gains the passage and refers to Asconius.

e does not, however, mention the other
instances of the annominatio given above.
Since his time no editor, so far as 1 am
amare, has accepted the correction. The

- corruption may be illustrated by Sull. 17

misit cornua, tubas, fasces, where Halm
notes {fasces VS, falcesTB, faces codd. alii,'
and Cat. ii. 13, where for fasces eight of
Halm's MSS. give faces. The MSS.
reading facibus is indefensible. It could
only mean that the rioters tried to burn
the temple of Castor. As Graevius re-
marks, ‘aedes Castoris incensa non suit,
ne tentatumquidem incendium, nam, ut de
curia, traditum haberemns‚' which seems
true, considering the circumstantiality of
the accounts given by our authorities.
Modern editors explain the passage in
a very improbable manner. (i) They
accept falcibus from the dett„ the value
of which may be judged from the fact
that they also give ac rastris for acl
Castoris! (ii) Since Clodius during his
tribunate barricaded himself within this
temple, pulling up the steps (Sest. 85,
Pis. 11, Dom. 54, 110, Har. Resp. 28,
&c.)‚ it is supposed that his disciples now
wish to imitate their master. (iii) In
order to pull up the steps they are sup-
posed to have used falces. Since, however,
‘sickles' or ‘books' are not suited for
such a task, reference is made to the

falces murales used to pull down the

seribing the behaviour of the rioters who walls of a besieged town, Caes. B. G. iii.

went about carrying the fasces, cf. Ascon.
